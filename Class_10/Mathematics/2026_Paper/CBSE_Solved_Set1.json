      "question": "If f(x) = 2x^3 - 5x + 4, what is the value of f'(2)?",
      "type": "MCQ",
      "options": [
        "19",
        "24",
        "14",
        "9"
      ],
      "answer": "19",
      "explanation": "First, find the derivative of the function f(x) with respect to x using the power rule: f'(x) = d/dx(2x^3) - d/dx(5x) + d/dx(4) = 6x^2 - 5. Next, substitute x = 2 into the derivative: f'(2) = 6(2)^2 - 5 = 6(4) - 5 = 24 - 5 = 19."

      "question": "Solve for x: 3^(2x-1) = 27.",
      "type": "Short Answer",
      "options": null,
      "answer": "2",
      "explanation": "Express both sides with the same base. Since 27 = 3^3, the equation becomes 3^(2x-1) = 3^3. Equate the exponents: 2x - 1 = 3. Add 1 to both sides: 2x = 4. Divide by 2: x = 2."

      "question": "Which of the following represents the discriminant of the quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0?",
      "type": "MCQ",
      "options": [
        "b^2 + 4ac",
        "b^2 - 4ac",
        "sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)",
        "2a"
      ],
      "answer": "b^2 - 4ac",
      "explanation": "The discriminant of a standard quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0 is defined as Δ = b^2 - 4ac. This value determines the nature of the roots (real and distinct, real and equal, or complex)."

      "question": "A bag contains 4 red marbles and 6 blue marbles. If two marbles are drawn without replacement, what is the probability that both are red?",
      "type": "Short Answer",
      "options": null,
      "answer": "2/15",
      "explanation": "The total number of marbles is 4 + 6 = 10. The probability of drawing a red marble first is 4/10. Since there is no replacement, there are now 9 marbles left, 3 of which are red. The probability of drawing a second red marble is 3/9. Multiply the probabilities: (4/10) * (3/9) = (2/5) * (1/3) = 2/15."

        "4x^4 + 2x^2 + C",
        "x^4 + 2x^2 + C"
      ],
      "answer": "x^4 + x^2 + C",
      "explanation": "Apply the power rule for integration, ∫x^n dx = (x^(n+1))/(n+1). For 4x^3: (4x^4)/4 = x^4. For 2x: (2x^2)/2 = x^2. Adding the constant of integration C, the result is x^4 + x^2 + C."
