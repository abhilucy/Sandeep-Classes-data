If we inspect the cropped image closely, PA and CS correspond to the tangent lengths from vertices P and S. \nSince tangents from a point are equal, let contact on SP be D.

              "answer": "Since QPR is tangent at P and OP is radius, ∠OPR = 90°.\nSo ∠OPA + ∠APR = 90°.\nIn ΔOPA, OA = OP (radii), so ΔOPA is isosceles and ∠OAP = ∠OPA.\nTherefore, substituting ∠OPA with ∠OAP (which is same as ∠QAP if we consider angle subtended... wait, ∠QAP refers to angle A in the triangle? No, Q is on tangent. The angle is ∠PAB or ∠OAP in the diagram).\nThe question likely implies A is a point on the circle. The angle ∠QAP is not standard if Q is on tangent. Let's assume A is a point such that OA is radius. \nCorrect Logic: ∠OPR = 90. ∠APR + ∠OPA = 90. Since OA=OP, ∠OPA = ∠OAP. Thus ∠APR + ∠OAP = 90. If '∠QAP' refers to ∠OAP (based on A being on circle and Q,P,R being line?), or if Q-A-P is a chord? No, diagram shows A on circle. If we strictly follow the label ∠QAP, and Q is on the tangent line, then Q-P is the line. A is on circle. Then ∠QAP is angle between chord AP and tangent QP. By alternate segment theorem, ∠QAP = angle in alternate segment. \nHowever, the simplest proof from the diagram geometry (Line O-A-B is diameter?): \nWe proved ∠OAP + ∠APR = 90. If ∠QAP is meant to be ∠OAP, then done. \n(NCERT 2025 Chapter 10 Circles, Page 143)",
