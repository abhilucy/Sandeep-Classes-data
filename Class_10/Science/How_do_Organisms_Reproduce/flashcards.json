    {
      "front": "Is reproduction necessary for the survival of an individual organism?",
      "back": "No, reproduction is not essential to maintain the life of an individual."
    },
    {
      "front": "Why do organisms exist in large numbers?",
      "back": "Because reproduction produces new individuals of the same species."
    },
    {
      "front": "What causes similarity between parents and offspring?",

    {
      "front": "Are DNA copies exactly identical?",
      "back": "No, minor variations occur due to inaccuracies in copying."

      "front": "What is multiple fission?",
      "back": "Division of a cell into many daughter cells at the same time."

    {
      "front": "How does Spirogyra reproduce?",
      "back": "By fragmentation."

      "back": "Reproduction using vegetative parts like root, stem or leaves."
    },

    {
      "front": "Why is sexual reproduction important?",
      "back": "It produces variation by combining DNA from two parents."
    },
