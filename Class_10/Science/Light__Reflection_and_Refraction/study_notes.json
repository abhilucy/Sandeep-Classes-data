Introduction to Light**\nLight is a form of energy that enables us to see objects.\n*   **Properties of Light:**\n    *   It is an electromagnetic wave; it does not require a material medium to travel.\n    *   Light travels in a straight line (Rectilinear propagation).\n    *   The speed of light in a vacuum is $c = 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s.\n    *   Light has dual nature: Wave nature and Particle nature.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Reflection of Light**\nThe bouncing back of light when it strikes a polished surface like a mirror.\n\n#### **Laws of Reflection**\n1.  The angle of incidence ($i$) is equal to the angle of reflection ($r$).\n    $$ \\angle i = \\angle r $$\n2.  The incident ray, the normal to the mirror at the point of incidence, and the reflected ray, all lie in the same plane.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Spherical Mirrors**\nMirrors whose reflecting surfaces are spherical.\n\n*   **Concave Mirror:** Reflecting surface is curved inwards. (Converging mirror).\n*   **Convex Mirror:** Reflecting surface is curved outwards. (Diverging mirror).\n\n#### **Important Terms**\n*   **Pole ($P$):** The center of the reflecting surface of the mirror.\n*   **Center of Curvature ($C$):** The center of the hollow sphere of which the mirror is a part.\n*   **Radius of Curvature ($R$):** The radius of the sphere ($PC$).\n*   **Principal Axis:** The straight line passing through the pole and the center of curvature.\n*   **Principal Focus ($F$):**\n    *   **Concave:** Point on the axis where parallel rays converge.\n    *   **Convex:** Point on the axis from where parallel rays appear to diverge.\n*   **Focal Length ($f$):** The distance between the Pole and the Principal Focus.\n\n**Relationship between Radius and Focal Length:**\n$$ R = 2f $$\n\n---\n\n### **4. Image Formation by Spherical Mirrors**\n\n#### **Rules for Ray Diagrams**\n1.  A ray parallel to the principal axis passes through $F$ (concave) or appears to diverge from $F$ (convex) after reflection.\n2.  A ray passing through $F$ (concave) or directed towards $F$ (convex) becomes parallel to the principal axis.\n3.  A ray passing through $C$ is reflected back along the same path.\n4.  A ray incident obliquely to the principal axis at $P$ is reflected obliquely, following laws of reflection ($\\angle i = \\angle r$).\n\n#### **Case A: Concave Mirror (Image Formation)**\n\n[DIAGRAM: Concave Mirror Ray Diagrams]\n*   **Diagram 1:** Object at Infinity -> Image at F (Point size).\n*   **Diagram 2:** Object beyond C -> Image between F and C.\n*   **Diagram 3:** Object at C -> Image at C.\n*   **Diagram 4:** Object between C and F -> Image beyond C.\n*   **Diagram 5:** Object at F -> Image at Infinity.\n*   **Diagram 6:** Object between P and F -> Image behind mirror (Virtual & Erect).\n[/DIAGRAM]\n\n**Summary Table: Image by Concave Mirror**\n\n| Position of Object | Position of Image | Size of Image | Nature of Image |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| At infinity | At focus $F$ | Highly diminished, point-sized | Real and inverted |\n| Beyond $C$ | Between $F$ and $C$ | Diminished | Real and inverted |\n| At $C$ | At $C$ | Same size | Real and inverted |\n| Between $C$ and $F$ | Beyond $C$ | Enlarged | Real and inverted |\n| At $F$ | At infinity | Highly enlarged | Real and inverted |\n| Between $P$ and $F$ | Behind the mirror | Enlarged | Virtual and erect |\n\n#### **Case B: Convex Mirror (Image Formation)**\n\n[DIAGRAM: Convex Mirror Ray Diagrams]\n*   **Diagram 1:** Object at Infinity -> Image at F behind mirror.\n*   **Diagram 2:** Object between Infinity and Pole -> Image between P and F behind mirror.\n[/DIAGRAM]\n\n**Summary Table: Image by Convex Mirror**\n\n| Position of Object | Position of Image | Size of Image | Nature of Image |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| At infinity | At focus $F$, behind mirror | Highly diminished, point-sized | Virtual and erect |\n| Between infinity and pole $P$ | Between $P$ and $F$, behind mirror | Diminished | Virtual and erect |\n\n---\n\n### **5. Mirror Formula and Magnification**\n\n#### **Sign Convention (New Cartesian)**\n*   Object is always placed to the left of the mirror.\n*   All distances parallel to the principal axis are measured from the Pole ($P$).\n*   Distances in the direction of incident light are positive ($+$).\n*   Distances against the direction of incident light are negative ($-$).\n*   Height upwards (perpendicular to axis) is positive ($+$).\n*   Height downwards is negative ($-$).\n\n#### **Mirror Formula**\n$$ \\frac{1}{v} + \\frac{1}{u} = \\frac{1}{f} $$\n*   $u$ = Object distance\n*   $v$ = Image distance\n*   $f$ = Focal length\n\n#### **Magnification ($m$)**\nMagnification gives the relative extent to which the image of an object is magnified with respect to the object size.\n$$ m = \\frac{\\text{Height of Image }(h')}{\\text{Height of Object }(h)} $$\n\n$$ m = \\frac{h'}{h} = -\\frac{v}{u} $$\n\n*   If $m$ is negative: Image is Real.\n*   If $m$ is positive: Image is Virtual.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Refraction of Light**\nThe bending of a ray of light when it passes from one transparent medium to another.\n\n*   **Rarer to Denser:** Light bends **towards** the normal.\n*   **Denser to Rarer:** Light bends **away** from the normal.\n*   **Cause:** Change in speed of light in different media.\n\n#### **Laws of Refraction**\n1.  The incident ray, the refracted ray, and the normal to the interface of two transparent media at the point of incidence, all lie in the same plane.\n2.  **Snell’s Law:** The ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence to the sine of the angle of refraction is a constant for the light of a given color and for the given pair of media.\n    $$ \\frac{\\sin i}{\\sin r} = \\text{constant} $$\n\n---\n\n### **7. Refractive Index**\nThe refractive index represents the extent of change in direction (bending) of light in a given pair of media.\n\n#### **Relative Refractive Index ($n_{21}$)**\nRefractive index of medium 2 with respect to medium 1:\n$$ n_{21} = \\frac{\\text{Speed of light in medium 1}}{\\text{Speed of light in medium 2}} = \\frac{v_1}{v_2} $$\n\nSimilarly, refractive index of medium 1 with respect to medium 2 ($n_{12}$):\n$$ n_{12} = \\frac{v_2}{v_1} $$\n\n#### **Absolute Refractive Index ($n_m$)**\nIf medium 1 is a vacuum or air, the refractive index of medium 2 is considered with respect to vacuum.\n$$ n_m = \\frac{\\text{Speed of light in air } (c)}{\\text{Speed of light in medium } (v)} = \\frac{c}{v} $$\n\n*   Water: $n_w = 1.33$\n*   Glass: $n_g = 1.52$\n*   Diamond: $n_d = 2.42$ (Highest optical density).\n\n---\n\n### **8. Refraction by Spherical Lenses**\nA transparent material bound by two surfaces, of which one or both surfaces are spherical.\n\n*   **Convex Lens:** Thicker at the middle, thinner at edges. (Converging lens).\n*   **Concave Lens:** Thinner at the middle, thicker at edges. (Diverging lens).\n\n#### **Image Formation by Lenses**\n\n#### **Case A: Convex Lens**\n\n[DIAGRAM: Convex Lens Ray Diagrams]\n*   **Diagram 1:** Object at Infinity -> Image at F2.\n*   **Diagram 2:** Object beyond 2F1 -> Image between F2 and 2F2.\n*   **Diagram 3:** Object at 2F1 -> Image at 2F2.\n*   **Diagram 4:** Object between F1 and 2F1 -> Image beyond 2F2.\n*   **Diagram 5:** Object at F1 -> Image at Infinity.\n*   **Diagram 6:** Object between F1 and Optical Center -> Image on same side (Virtual).\n[/DIAGRAM]\n\n**Summary Table: Image by Convex Lens**\n\n| Position of Object | Position of Image | Relative Size | Nature of Image |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| At infinity | At focus $F_2$ | Highly diminished, point-sized | Real and inverted |\n| Beyond $2F_1$ | Between $F_2$ and $2F_2$ | Diminished | Real and inverted |\n| At $2F_1$ | At $2F_2$ | Same size | Real and inverted |\n| Between $F_1$ and $2F_1$ | Beyond $2F_2$ | Enlarged | Real and inverted |\n| At focus $F_1$ | At infinity | Infinitely large | Real and inverted |\n| Between $F_1$ and $O$ | On same side as object | Enlarged | Virtual and erect |\n\n#### **Case B: Concave Lens**\n\n[DIAGRAM: Concave Lens Ray Diagrams]\n*   **Diagram 1:** Object at Infinity -> Image at F1.\n*   **Diagram 2:** Object between Infinity and Optical Center -> Image between F1 and O.\n[/DIAGRAM]\n\n**Summary Table: Image by Concave Lens**\n\n| Position of Object | Position of Image | Relative Size | Nature of Image |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| At infinity | At focus $F_1$ | Highly diminished, point-sized | Virtual and erect |\n| Between infinity and $O$ | Between focus $F_1$ and $O$ | Diminished | Virtual and erect |\n\n---\n\n### **9. Lens Formula and Power**\n\n#### **Lens Formula**\nRelationship between object distance ($u$), image distance ($v$), and focal length ($f$).\n$$ \\frac{1}{v} - \\frac{1}{u} = \\frac{1}{f} $$\n\n#### **Magnification ($m$)**\n$$ m = \\frac{\\text{Height of Image }(h')}{\\text{Height of Object }(h)} = \\frac{v}{u} $$\n\n#### **Power of a Lens ($P$)**\nThe ability of a lens to converge or diverge light rays. It is defined as the reciprocal of the focal length (in meters).\n\n$$ P = \\frac{1}{f(\\text{in meters})} $$\n\n*   **SI Unit:** Dioptre ($D$).\n*   $1D = 1 m^{-1}$.\n*   Power of **Convex Lens**: Positive ($+$).\n*   Power of **Concave Lens**: Negative ($-$).\n*   **Power of Combination:** If lenses are placed in contact, net power $P = P_1 + P_2 + P_3 \\dots$\n\n---\n*Sandeep Coaching Classes - Excellence in Education*"
