INTRODUCTION TO LIGHT\nLight is a form of energy that enables us to see objects.\n*   **Properties of Light:**\n    *   It travels in straight lines (Rectilinear propagation).\n    *   It does not require a material medium to travel (can travel through a vacuum).\n    *   Speed of light in vacuum, $c = 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s.\n    *   Light exhibits dual nature (Wave and Particle).\n\n---\n\n### 2. REFLECTION OF LIGHT\nBouncing back of light when it strikes a polished surface like a mirror.\n\n**Laws of Reflection:**\n1.  The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection ($\\angle i = \\angle r$).\n2.  The incident ray, the normal to the mirror at the point of incidence, and the reflected ray, all lie in the same plane.\n\n[DIAGRAM: Reflection on a Plane Surface | Show Incident ray, Normal, Reflected ray, Angle i, Angle r]\n\n---\n\n### 3. SPHERICAL MIRRORS\nMirrors whose reflecting surfaces are spherical.\n\n*   **Concave Mirror:** Reflecting surface is curved inwards. (Converging mirror).\n*   **Convex Mirror:** Reflecting surface is curved outwards. (Diverging mirror).\n\n**Key Terms:**\n*   **Pole (P):** The center of the reflecting surface.\n*   **Center of Curvature (C):** The center of the hollow sphere of which the mirror is a part.\n*   **Radius of Curvature (R):** Distance between P and C.\n*   **Principal Axis:** Straight line passing through P and C.\n*   **Principal Focus (F):** The point on the principal axis where rays parallel to the axis meet (concave) or appear to diverge from (convex).\n*   **Focal Length ($f$):** Distance between Pole (P) and Focus (F).\n\n**Relationship between R and f:**\n$$ R = 2f $$\n\n[DIAGRAM: Focus of Concave and Convex Mirrors | Parallel rays converging at F (Concave) and diverging from F (Convex)]\n\n---\n\n### 4. IMAGE FORMATION BY SPHERICAL MIRRORS\n\n**Rules for Ray Diagrams:**\n1.  A ray parallel to the principal axis passes through the focus after reflection.\n2.  A ray passing through the focus becomes parallel to the principal axis after reflection.\n3.  A ray passing through the Center of Curvature (C) retraces its path.\n4.  A ray incident obliquely to the Pole reflects obliquely ($\\angle i = \\angle r$).\n\n[DIAGRAM: Ray Diagram Rules | Visualizing the 4 rules mentioned above]\n\n**Uses of Mirrors:**\n*   **Concave:** Torches, searchlights, shaving mirrors, dentist mirrors, solar furnaces.\n*   **Convex:** Rear-view mirrors in vehicles (gives a wide field of view and erect, diminished image).\n\n---\n\n### 5. SIGN CONVENTION & MIRROR FORMULA\n\n**New Cartesian Sign Convention:**\n*   The object is always placed to the left of the mirror.\n*   All distances are measured from the Pole (P).\n*   Distances in the direction of incident light are **positive (+)**.\n*   Distances against the direction of incident light are **negative (-)**.\n*   Heights upwards (above axis) are **positive (+)**; downwards are **negative (-)**.\n\n**Mirror Formula:**\n$$ \\frac{1}{v} + \\frac{1}{u} = \\frac{1}{f} $$\n\nWhere:\n*   $u$ = Object distance\n*   $v$ = Image distance\n*   $f$ = Focal length\n\n**Magnification ($m$):**\nMagnification gives the relative extent to which an image is magnified with respect to the object size.\n\n$$ m = \\frac{\\text{Height of image }(h')}{\\text{Height of object }(h)} = -\\frac{v}{u} $$\n\n*   If $m$ is negative: Image is Real and Inverted.\n*   If $m$ is positive: Image is Virtual and Erect.\n\n---\n\n### 6. REFRACTION OF LIGHT\nBending of a light ray when it passes from one transparent medium to another.\n\n**Cause of Refraction:** Change in the speed of light in different media.\n*   **Rarer to Denser:** Light bends **towards** the normal (Speed decreases).\n*   **Denser to Rarer:** Light bends **away from** the normal (Speed increases).\n\n[DIAGRAM: Refraction through Glass Slab | Incident ray, Refracted ray, Emergent ray, Lateral displacement]\n\n**Laws of Refraction:**\n1.  The incident ray, the refracted ray, and the normal to the interface of two transparent media at the point of incidence, all lie in the same plane.\n2.  **Snell’s Law:** The ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence to the sine of the angle of refraction is a constant for the light of a given color and for the given pair of media.\n    $$ \\frac{\\sin i}{\\sin r} = \\text{constant} $$\n\n---\n\n### 7. REFRACTIVE INDEX\n\n**Relative Refractive Index ($n_{21}$):**\nThe refractive index of medium 2 with respect to medium 1 is the ratio of the speed of light in medium 1 ($v_1$) to the speed of light in medium 2 ($v_2$).\n\n$$ n_{21} = \\frac{\\text{Speed of light in medium 1}}{\\text{Speed of light in medium 2}} = \\frac{v_1}{v_2} $$\n\nSimilarly, refractive index of medium 1 w.r.t medium 2:\n$$ n_{12} = \\frac{v_2}{v_1} $$\n\n**Absolute Refractive Index ($n_m$):**\nIf medium 1 is a vacuum (or air), then the refractive index of medium 2 is considered with respect to vacuum. This is called the absolute refractive index.\n\n$$ n_m = \\frac{\\text{Speed of light in air }(c)}{\\text{Speed of light in medium }(v)} = \\frac{c}{v} $$\n\n*Note: The absolute refractive index of a medium is simply represented as $n_2$.*\n\n---\n\n### 8. SPHERICAL LENSES\nA transparent material bound by two surfaces, of which one or both surfaces are spherical.\n\n*   **Convex Lens:** Thicker at the middle, thinner at edges (Converging action).\n*   **Concave Lens:** Thinner at the middle, thicker at edges (Diverging action).\n\n[DIAGRAM: Action of Lenses | Convex lens converging rays at F; Concave lens diverging rays]\n\n**Image Formation by Lenses:**\n*   **Convex Lens:** Forms Real & Inverted images (except when object is between F and Optical Center, then Virtual & Erect).\n*   **Concave Lens:** Always forms Virtual, Erect, and Diminished images.\n\n---\n\n### 9. LENS FORMULA, MAGNIFICATION & POWER\n\n**Lens Formula:**\n$$ \\frac{1}{v} - \\frac{1}{u} = \\frac{1}{f} $$\n\n**Magnification ($m$):**\n$$ m = \\frac{h'}{h} = \\frac{v}{u} $$\n\n*(Note: Unlike mirrors, the formula uses $+v/u$)*\n\n**Power of a Lens ($P$):**\nThe ability of a lens to converge or diverge light rays is defined as its power. It is the reciprocal of its focal length.\n\n$$ P = \\frac{1}{f} $$\n\n*   **SI Unit:** Dioptre (D).\n*   **Condition:** Focal length ($f$) must be in **meters**.\n*   Power of Convex lens is **Positive (+)**.\n*   Power of Concave lens is **Negative (-)**.\n\n**Power of Combination of Lenses:**\nIf multiple lenses are placed in contact:\n$$ P = P_1 + P_2 + P_3 + \\dots $$"
