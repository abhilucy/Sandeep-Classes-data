NATURE OF LIGHT\nLight is a form of energy that enables us to see objects. It exhibits a dual nature: particle nature and wave nature (Electromagnetic wave).\n*   **Propagation:** Light travels in straight lines (rectilinear propagation).\n*   **Speed:** In a vacuum, light travels at approximately $3 \\times 10^8$ m/s.\n\n---\n\n### 2. REFLECTION OF LIGHT\nThe process of sending back light rays which fall on the surface of an object is called reflection.\n\n**Laws of Reflection:**\n1.  The angle of incidence ($\\angle i$) is always equal to the angle of reflection ($\\angle r$).\n2.  The incident ray, the reflected ray, and the normal at the point of incidence, all lie in the same plane.\n\n[DIAGRAM: Reflection on a Plane Surface | Angle i = Angle r | Incident, Normal, and Reflected rays are coplanar]\n\n---\n\n### 3. SPHERICAL MIRRORS\nMirrors having curved reflecting surfaces are called spherical mirrors.\n*   **Concave Mirror:** Reflecting surface is curved inwards (Converging mirror).\n*   **Convex Mirror:** Reflecting surface is curved outwards (Diverging mirror).\n\n**Key Terms:**\n*   **Pole (P):** Center of the reflecting surface.\n*   **Center of Curvature (C):** Center of the sphere of which the mirror is a part.\n*   **Principal Axis:** Straight line passing through P and C.\n*   **Principal Focus (F):** Point where parallel rays meet (or appear to meet) after reflection.\n*   **Relationship:** $R = 2f$ (Radius of curvature is twice the focal length).\n\n[DIAGRAM: Spherical Mirror Components | Principal Focus (F) is halfway between P and C | Rays parallel to the axis converge at F in concave mirrors]\n\n---\n\n### 4. MIRROR FORMULA AND MAGNIFICATION\n**Mirror Formula:** \n$$\\frac{1}{v} + \\frac{1}{u} = \\frac{1}{f}$$\n*(Where $u$ = object distance, $v$ = image distance, $f$ = focal length)*\n\n**Magnification (m):** \n$$m = \\frac{h'}{h} = -\\frac{v}{u}$$\n*   If $m$ is negative, the image is **Real and Inverted**.\n*   If $m$ is positive, the image is **Virtual and Erect**.\n\n---\n\n### 5. REFRACTION OF LIGHT\nThe bending of light when it passes obliquely from one transparent medium to another is called refraction. It occurs due to the change in the speed of light.\n\n**Laws of Refraction:**\n1.  The incident ray, refracted ray, and the normal at the point of incidence all lie in the same plane.\n2.  **Snell’s Law:** The ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence to the sine of the angle of refraction is constant for a given pair of media.\n    $$\\frac{\\sin i}{\\sin r} = \\text{constant (n)}$$\n\n[DIAGRAM: Refraction through Glass Slab | Light bends towards normal in denser medium | Emergent ray is parallel to Incident ray]\n\n**Refractive Index (n):**\n$$n = \\frac{\\text{Speed of light in vacuum (c)}}{\\text{Speed of light in medium (v)}}$$\n\n---\n\n### 6. REFRACTION BY SPHERICAL LENSES\n*   **Convex Lens:** Thick at the center, thin at edges (Converging).\n*   **Concave Lens:** Thin at the center, thick at edges (Diverging).\n\n**Lens Formula:** \n$$\\frac{1}{v} - \\frac{1}{u} = \\frac{1}{f}$$\n\n**Magnification (m):** \n$$m = \\frac{h'}{h} = \\frac{v}{u}$$\n\n[DIAGRAM: Image Formation by Convex Lens | Object at 2F1 produces image at 2F2 | Image is real, inverted, and same size]\n\n---\n\n### 7. POWER OF A LENS\nThe degree of convergence or divergence of light rays achieved by a lens is expressed as its Power (P).\n*   **Formula:** $P = \\frac{1}{f (\\text{in meters})}$\n*   **SI Unit:** Dioptre (D).\n*   **Note:** Power is positive for a Convex lens and negative for a Concave lens.\n\n---\n**Editor's Note:** *Students are advised to practice ray diagrams for all six cases of concave mirrors and two cases of convex mirrors to ensure marks in the board examinations.*"
