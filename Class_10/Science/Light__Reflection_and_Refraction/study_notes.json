Introduction to Light**\nLight is a form of energy that enables us to see objects. It travels in straight lines (Rectilinear propagation of light).\n*   **Speed of Light:** The speed of light in a vacuum is $c = 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s.\n*   **Nature:** Light has a dual nature (Wave nature and Particle nature).\n\n### **2. Reflection of Light**\nBouncing back of light when it strikes a polished surface like a mirror.\n\n**Laws of Reflection:**\n1.  The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection ($\\angle i = \\angle r$).\n2.  The incident ray, the normal to the mirror at the point of incidence, and the reflected ray, all lie in the same plane.\n\n[DIAGRAM: Reflection of light showing Incident Ray, Reflected Ray, Normal, Angle i, and Angle r]\n\n---\n\n### **3. Spherical Mirrors**\nMirrors whose reflecting surfaces are spherical.\n*   **Concave Mirror:** Reflecting surface is curved inwards. Converging mirror.\n*   **Convex Mirror:** Reflecting surface is curved outwards. Diverging mirror.\n\n**Important Terms:**\n*   **Pole ($P$):** The center of the reflecting surface.\n*   **Center of Curvature ($C$):** The center of the hollow sphere of which the mirror is a part.\n*   **Radius of Curvature ($R$):** The distance between the pole and the center of curvature.\n*   **Principal Axis:** The straight line passing through the pole and the center of curvature.\n*   **Focus ($F$):** The point on the principal axis where rays parallel to the axis meet (concave) or appear to diverge from (convex).\n*   **Focal Length ($f$):** The distance between the pole and the principal focus.\n\n**Relationship between $R$ and $f$:**\n$$R = 2f$$\n\n[DIAGRAM: Components of Spherical Mirrors (C, F, P, R, f) for both Concave and Convex]\n\n---\n\n### **4. Image Formation by Spherical Mirrors**\n\n#### **A. Concave Mirror**\n\n| Position of Object | Position of Image | Size of Image | Nature of Image |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| At Infinity | At Focus ($F$) | Highly Diminished (Point size) | Real and Inverted |\n| Beyond $C$ | Between $F$ and $C$ | Diminished | Real and Inverted |\n| At $C$ | At $C$ | Same size | Real and Inverted |\n| Between $C$ and $F$ | Beyond $C$ | Enlarged | Real and Inverted |\n| At $F$ | At Infinity | Highly Enlarged | Real and Inverted |\n| Between $P$ and $F$ | Behind the mirror | Enlarged | Virtual and Erect |\n\n#### **B. Convex Mirror**\n\n| Position of Object | Position of Image | Size of Image | Nature of Image |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| At Infinity | At Focus ($F$) behind mirror | Highly Diminished (Point size) | Virtual and Erect |\n| Between Infinity and Pole | Between $P$ and $F$ behind mirror | Diminished | Virtual and Erect |\n\n[DIAGRAM: Ray diagrams showing image formation for Concave (6 cases) and Convex (2 cases) mirrors]\n\n---\n\n### **5. Sign Convention & Mirror Formula**\n\n**New Cartesian Sign Convention:**\n*   Object is always placed to the left of the mirror.\n*   All distances are measured from the Pole ($P$).\n*   Distances in the direction of incident light are positive (+).\n*   Distances against the direction of incident light are negative (-).\n*   Heights upwards (above axis) are positive; heights downwards are negative.\n\n**Mirror Formula:**\n$$\\frac{1}{v} + \\frac{1}{u} = \\frac{1}{f}$$\n\nWhere:\n*   $u$ = Object distance\n*   $v$ = Image distance\n*   $f$ = Focal length\n\n**Magnification ($m$):**\nIt is the ratio of the height of the image to the height of the object.\n$$m = \\frac{\\text{Height of image}}{\\text{Height of object}} = \\frac{h'}{h}$$\nAlso, in terms of distance:\n$$m = -\\frac{v}{u}$$\n\n*   If $m$ is negative: Image is Real.\n*   If $m$ is positive: Image is Virtual.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Refraction of Light**\nThe change in direction (bending) of light when it passes from one transparent medium to another.\n\n**Rules of Refraction:**\n1.  **Rarer to Denser:** Light bends **towards** the normal.\n2.  **Denser to Rarer:** Light bends **away** from the normal.\n\n[DIAGRAM: Refraction through a Rectangular Glass Slab showing lateral displacement]\n\n---\n\n### **7. Laws of Refraction**\n1.  The incident ray, the refracted ray, and the normal to the interface of two transparent media at the point of incidence, all lie in the same plane.\n2.  **Snell’s Law:** The ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence to the sine of the angle of refraction is a constant for the light of a given color and for the given pair of media.\n    $$\\frac{\\sin i}{\\sin r} = \\text{constant}$$\n\n**Refractive Index ($n$):**\nThe constant in Snell's law is the refractive index of the second medium with respect to the first.\n\n**Relative Refractive Index ($n_{21}$):**\nRefractive index of medium 2 with respect to medium 1:\n$$n_{21} = \\frac{\\text{Speed of light in medium 1}}{\\text{Speed of light in medium 2}} = \\frac{v_1}{v_2}$$\n\n**Absolute Refractive Index ($n_m$):**\nIf medium 1 is vacuum or air:\n$$n_m = \\frac{c}{v}$$\n\n---\n\n### **8. Spherical Lenses**\n*   **Convex Lens:** Thicker at the middle, thinner at edges. Converging lens.\n*   **Concave Lens:** Thinner at the middle, thicker at edges. Diverging lens.\n\n[DIAGRAM: Anatomy of Lenses: Optical Centre (O), Focus (F1, F2), and 2F]\n\n### **9. Image Formation by Lenses**\n\n#### **A. Convex Lens**\n\n| Position of Object | Position of Image | Size of Image | Nature of Image |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| At Infinity | At $F_2$ | Highly Diminished (Point size) | Real and Inverted |\n| Beyond $2F_1$ | Between $F_2$ and $2F_2$ | Diminished | Real and Inverted |\n| At $2F_1$ | At $2F_2$ | Same size | Real and Inverted |\n| Between $F_1$ and $2F_1$ | Beyond $2F_2$ | Enlarged | Real and Inverted |\n| At $F_1$ | At Infinity | Highly Enlarged | Real and Inverted |\n| Between $F_1$ and $O$ | On the same side as object | Enlarged | Virtual and Erect |\n\n#### **B. Concave Lens**\n\n| Position of Object | Position of Image | Size of Image | Nature of Image |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| At Infinity | At Focus $F_1$ | Highly Diminished | Virtual and Erect |\n| Between Infinity and $O$ | Between $F_1$ and $O$ | Diminished | Virtual and Erect |\n\n[DIAGRAM: Ray diagrams for Convex Lens (6 cases) and Concave Lens (2 cases)]\n\n---\n\n### **10. Lens Formula and Magnification**\n\n**Lens Formula:**\n$$\\frac{1}{v} - \\frac{1}{u} = \\frac{1}{f}$$\n\n**Magnification ($m$):**\n$$m = \\frac{h'}{h} = \\frac{v}{u}$$\n*(Note: Unlike mirrors, there is no negative sign in the v/u ratio for lenses)*\n\n### **11. Power of a Lens ($P$)**\nThe degree of convergence or divergence of light rays achieved by a lens. It is the reciprocal of the focal length (in meters).\n\n$$P = \\frac{1}{f}$$\n\n*   **SI Unit:** Dioptre ($D$).\n*   $1 D = 1 m^{-1}$.\n*   Power of Convex lens is Positive ($+$).\n*   Power of Concave lens is Negative ($-$).\n\n**Power of Combination of Lenses:**\nIf multiple lenses are placed in contact, the net power $P$ is the algebraic sum of individual powers:\n$$P = P_1 + P_2 + P_3 + \\dots$$"
