Introduction to Light\nLight is a form of energy that enables us to see. It acts as an electromagnetic wave and does not require a material medium for propagation.\n\n**Properties of Light:**\n*   It travels in a straight line (Rectilinear propagation).\n*   It has a dual nature (Wave and Particle).\n*   Speed of light in vacuum: $c = 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s.\n\n::: NCERT Viewer :::\n**Key Concept:** Light creates the sensation of vision. When light falls on an object, it reflects light; when this reflected light reaches our eyes, we see the object.\n::::::::::::::::::::\n\n---\n\n## 2. Reflection of Light\nThe bouncing back of light rays when they strike a polished surface (like a mirror) is called reflection.\n\n### Laws of Reflection\n1.  The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection ($i = r$).\n2.  The incident ray, the normal to the mirror at the point of incidence, and the reflected ray, all lie in the same plane.\n\n::: NCERT Viewer :::\n**Note:** These laws apply to all types of reflecting surfaces including spherical surfaces (curved mirrors).\n::::::::::::::::::::\n\n---\n\n## 3. Spherical Mirrors\nA spherical mirror is a mirror whose reflecting surface is a part of a hollow sphere of glass.\n\n### Terminology\n*   **Pole ($P$):** The center of the reflecting surface.\n*   **Center of Curvature ($C$):** The center of the hollow sphere of which the mirror is a part.\n*   **Radius of Curvature ($R$):** The distance between the Pole and the Center of Curvature.\n*   **Principal Axis:** The straight line passing through $P$ and $C$.\n*   **Principal Focus ($F$):** The point on the principal axis where rays parallel to the axis converge (concave) or appear to diverge from (convex).\n*   **Relationship:** $R = 2f$ (Radius is twice the focal length).\n\n### A. Concave Mirror (Converging Mirror)\nThe reflecting surface is curved inwards.\n\n[DIAGRAM: Draw a Concave Mirror showing rays parallel to the principal axis converging at Focus F.]\n\n**Image Formation by Concave Mirror:**\n\n1.  **Object at Infinity:** Image at $F$, Real, Inverted, Highly Diminished.\n2.  **Object Beyond $C$:** Image between $F$ and $C$, Real, Inverted, Diminished.\n3.  **Object at $C$:** Image at $C$, Real, Inverted, Same size.\n4.  **Object between $C$ and $F$:** Image beyond $C$, Real, Inverted, Enlarged.\n5.  **Object at $F$:** Image at Infinity, Real, Inverted, Highly Enlarged.\n6.  **Object between $P$ and $F$:** Image behind mirror, Virtual, Erect, Enlarged.\n\n::: NCERT Viewer :::\n**Applications of Concave Mirrors:**\n1. Torches, searchlights, and vehicle headlights (to get parallel beams).\n2. Shaving mirrors (to see a larger image of the face).\n3. Dentist mirrors.\n4. Solar furnaces (to concentrate sunlight).\n::::::::::::::::::::\n\n### B. Convex Mirror (Diverging Mirror)\nThe reflecting surface is curved outwards.\n\n[DIAGRAM: Draw a Convex Mirror showing rays parallel to the principal axis diverging, appearing to come from Focus F behind the mirror.]\n\n**Image Formation by Convex Mirror:**\n\n1.  **Object at Infinity:** Image at $F$ (behind mirror), Virtual, Erect, Point-sized.\n2.  **Object anywhere between Infinity and Pole:** Image between $P$ and $F$ (behind mirror), Virtual, Erect, Diminished.\n\n::: NCERT Viewer :::\n**Why are Convex mirrors used as rear-view mirrors?**\nThey always give an erect, diminished image. This provides a wider field of view, allowing the driver to see more traffic behind them compared to a plane mirror.\n::::::::::::::::::::\n\n---\n\n## 4. Mirror Formula and Magnification\n\n### Sign Convention (New Cartesian)\n*   The Pole ($P$) is the origin.\n*   Direction of incident light is positive (+). Opposite direction is negative (-).\n*   Distances measured upward from the principal axis are positive (+).\n*   Distances measured downward are negative (-).\n\n### Mirror Formula\nThis relates object distance ($u$), image distance ($v$), and focal length ($f$):\n\n$$\\frac{1}{v} + \\frac{1}{u} = \\frac{1}{f}$$\n\n### Magnification ($m$)\nMagnification gives the relative extent to which an image is magnified with respect to the object size.\n\n$$m = \\frac{\\text{Height of Image (h')}}{\\text{Height of Object (h)}} = -\\frac{v}{u}$$\n\n*   If $m$ is negative: Image is Real.\n*   If $m$ is positive: Image is Virtual.\n\n::: NCERT Viewer :::\n**Numerical Tip:**\n*   $u$ is always negative.\n*   $f$ is negative for Concave Mirrors.\n*   $f$ is positive for Convex Mirrors.\n::::::::::::::::::::\n\n---\n\n## 5. Refraction of Light\nRefraction is the bending of light when it passes from one transparent medium to another.\n\n*   **Rarer to Denser:** Light bends **towards** the normal.\n*   **Denser to Rarer:** Light bends **away** from the normal.\n\n### Laws of Refraction\n1.  The incident ray, the refracted ray, and the normal to the interface of two transparent media at the point of incidence, all lie in the same plane.\n2.  **Snell’s Law:** The ratio of sine of angle of incidence to the sine of angle of refraction is a constant for the light of a given color and for the given pair of media.\n    $$\\frac{\\sin i}{\\sin r} = \\text{constant}$$\n\n### Refractive Index\nThe constant in Snell's law is the refractive index of the second medium with respect to the first.\n\n**Relative Refractive Index:**\n$$n_{21} = \\frac{\\text{Speed of light in medium 1}}{\\text{Speed of light in medium 2}} = \\frac{v_1}{v_2}$$\n\n**Absolute Refractive Index ($n_m$):**\nIf medium 1 is vacuum or air:\n$$n_m = \\frac{c}{v}$$\n\n::: NCERT Viewer :::\n**Why does a pencil look bent in water?**\nThis is due to refraction. Light from the submerged part of the pencil travels from water (denser) to air (rarer), speeding up and bending away from the normal. Our eyes trace the rays back in a straight line, making the pencil appear raised/bent.\n::::::::::::::::::::\n\n---\n\n## 6. Refraction by Spherical Lenses\n\n### A. Convex Lens (Converging Action)\nThicker at the middle, thinner at edges.\n\n[DIAGRAM: Draw a Convex Lens showing parallel rays converging at the Focus F on the other side.]\n\n**Image Formation:**\n*   Acts similarly to a Concave Mirror (mostly Real/Inverted images, except when object is between Optical Center and Focus).\n\n### B. Concave Lens (Diverging Action)\nThinner at the middle, thicker at edges.\n\n[DIAGRAM: Draw a Concave Lens showing parallel rays diverging, appearing to originate from Focus F on the same side.]\n\n**Image Formation:**\n*   Always forms Virtual, Erect, and Diminished images (similar to Convex Mirror).\n\n::: NCERT Viewer :::\n**Key Difference:**\n*   Mirrors reflect light.\n*   Lenses refract light.\n*   A Convex Lens converges light to a real focus.\n*   A Concave Lens diverges light from a virtual focus.\n::::::::::::::::::::\n\n---\n\n## 7. Lens Formula, Magnification, and Power\n\n### Lens Formula\n$$\\frac{1}{v} - \\frac{1}{u} = \\frac{1}{f}$$\n\n*(Note the negative sign, unlike the mirror formula)*\n\n### Magnification ($m$)\n$$m = \\frac{h'}{h} = \\frac{v}{u}$$\n\n### Power of a Lens ($P$)\nThe ability of a lens to converge or diverge light rays. It is the reciprocal of focal length.\n\n$$P = \\frac{1}{f}$$\n\n*   **Unit:** Dioptre ($D$).\n*   **Condition:** Focal length ($f$) must be in meters.\n*   **Convex Lens:** Power is Positive (+).\n*   **Concave Lens:** Power is Negative (-).\n\n::: NCERT Viewer :::\n**Definition of 1 Dioptre:**\n1 Dioptre is the power of a lens whose focal length is 1 meter ($1D = 1m^{-1}$).\n\n**Combination of Lenses:**\nIf multiple lenses are placed in contact, the net power $P$ is the algebraic sum of individual powers:\n$$P = P_1 + P_2 + P_3 + \\dots$$\n::::::::::::::::::::"
