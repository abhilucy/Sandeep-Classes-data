Introduction to Light\n**Light** is a form of energy that enables us to see objects. It travels in straight lines (Rectilinear propagation of light).\n*   **Speed of light in vacuum ($c$):** $3 \\times 10^8$ m/s.\n*   **Reflection:** Bouncing back of light when it strikes a polished surface.\n*   **Refraction:** Bending of light when it travels from one medium to another.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Reflection of Light\n#### Laws of Reflection\n1.  The angle of incidence ($i$) is equal to the angle of reflection ($r$).\n2.  The incident ray, the normal to the mirror at the point of incidence, and the reflected ray, all lie in the same plane.\n\n#### Spherical Mirrors\nMirrors whose reflecting surfaces are spherical.\n*   **Concave Mirror:** Reflecting surface is curved inwards. (Converging mirror).\n*   **Convex Mirror:** Reflecting surface is curved outwards. (Diverging mirror).\n\n**Key Terms:**\n*   **Pole ($P$):** The center of the reflecting surface.\n*   **Center of Curvature ($C$):** The center of the hollow sphere of which the mirror is a part.\n*   **Radius of Curvature ($R$):** The distance between the Pole and the Center of Curvature.\n*   **Focus ($F$):** The point where parallel rays intersect (or appear to diverge from) after reflection.\n*   **Focal Length ($f$):** The distance between the Pole and the Focus.\n*   **Relationship between $R$ and $f$:**\n    $$R = 2f$$\n\n---\n\n### 3. Image Formation by Spherical Mirrors\n\n#### Image Formation by Concave Mirror\n\n| Position of Object | Position of Image | Size of Image | Nature of Image |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| At Infinity | At the Focus ($F$) | Highly diminished, point-sized | Real and Inverted |\n| Beyond $C$ | Between $F$ and $C$ | Diminished | Real and Inverted |\n| At $C$ | At $C$ | Same size | Real and Inverted |\n| Between $C$ and $F$ | Beyond $C$ | Enlarged | Real and Inverted |\n| At $F$ | At Infinity | Highly enlarged | Real and Inverted |\n| Between $P$ and $F$ | Behind the mirror | Enlarged | Virtual and Erect |\n\n#### Image Formation by Convex Mirror\n\n| Position of Object | Position of Image | Size of Image | Nature of Image |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| At Infinity | At the Focus ($F$), behind the mirror | Highly diminished, point-sized | Virtual and Erect |\n| Between Infinity and Pole ($P$) | Between $P$ and $F$, behind the mirror | Diminished | Virtual and Erect |\n\n---\n\n### 4. Sign Convention & Mirror Formula\n\n**New Cartesian Sign Convention:**\n*   The Pole ($P$) is the origin $(0,0)$.\n*   Distances measured in the direction of incident light are positive.\n*   Distances measured against the direction of incident light are negative.\n*   Heights upwards (above principal axis) are positive; downwards are negative.\n\n**Mirror Formula:**\n$$\\frac{1}{v} + \\frac{1}{u} = \\frac{1}{f}$$\n\nWhere:\n*   $u$ = Object distance (always negative)\n*   $v$ = Image distance\n*   $f$ = Focal length (Negative for Concave, Positive for Convex)\n\n**Magnification ($m$):**\n$$m = \\frac{\\text{Height of Image }(h')}{\\text{Height of Object }(h)} = -\\frac{v}{u}$$\n\n*   If $m$ is negative: Image is Real.\n*   If $m$ is positive: Image is Virtual.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Refraction of Light\nThe phenomenon of bending of light when it passes from one transparent medium to another.\n\n*   **Rarer to Denser:** Light bends **towards** the normal.\n*   **Denser to Rarer:** Light bends **away** from the normal.\n\n#### Refraction through a Rectangular Glass Slab\nWhen a light ray passes through a glass slab, the emergent ray is parallel to the incident ray but is shifted sideways. This shift is called **Lateral Displacement**.\n\n#### Laws of Refraction\n1.  The incident ray, the refracted ray, and the normal to the interface of two transparent media at the point of incidence, all lie in the same plane.\n2.  **Snell’s Law:** The ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence to the sine of the angle of refraction is a constant for the light of a given color and for the given pair of media.\n    $$\\frac{\\sin i}{\\sin r} = \\text{constant}$$\n\n---\n\n### 6. Refractive Index\n\nThe constant obtained in Snell's Law is the refractive index of the second medium with respect to the first.\n\n#### Relative Refractive Index ($n_{21}$)\nThe refractive index of medium 2 with respect to medium 1 is the ratio of the speed of light in medium 1 ($v_1$) to the speed of light in medium 2 ($v_2$).\n\n$$n_{21} = \\frac{\\text{Speed of light in medium 1}}{\\text{Speed of light in medium 2}} = \\frac{v_1}{v_2}$$\n\nSimilarly, refractive index of medium 1 with respect to medium 2:\n$$n_{12} = \\frac{v_2}{v_1}$$\n\n#### Absolute Refractive Index ($n_m$)\nIf medium 1 is vacuum or air, then the refractive index of medium 2 is considered with respect to vacuum. This is called the absolute refractive index of the medium.\n\n$$n_m = \\frac{\\text{Speed of light in air } (c)}{\\text{Speed of light in medium } (v)} = \\frac{c}{v}$$\n\n*   $n_{water} \\approx 1.33$\n*   $n_{glass} \\approx 1.5$\n*   $n_{diamond} \\approx 2.42$ (Highest optical density)\n\n---\n\n### 7. Refraction by Spherical Lenses\n\n*   **Convex Lens:** Thicker at the middle, thinner at edges. Converges light.\n*   **Concave Lens:** Thinner at the middle, thicker at edges. Diverges light.\n\n#### Image Formation by Convex Lens\n\n| Position of Object | Position of Image | Relative Size | Nature of Image |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| At Infinity | At Focus $F_2$ | Highly diminished, point-sized | Real and Inverted |\n| Beyond $2F_1$ | Between $F_2$ and $2F_2$ | Diminished | Real and Inverted |\n| At $2F_1$ | At $2F_2$ | Same size | Real and Inverted |\n| Between $F_1$ and $2F_1$ | Beyond $2F_2$ | Enlarged | Real and Inverted |\n| At Focus $F_1$ | At Infinity | Infinitely large | Real and Inverted |\n| Between $F_1$ and Optical Center $O$ | On the same side as the object | Enlarged | Virtual and Erect |\n\n#### Image Formation by Concave Lens\n\n| Position of Object | Position of Image | Relative Size | Nature of Image |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| At Infinity | At Focus $F_1$ | Highly diminished, point-sized | Virtual and Erect |\n| Between Infinity and Optical Center $O$ | Between Focus $F_1$ and $O$ | Diminished | Virtual and Erect |\n\n---\n\n### 8. Lens Formula, Magnification, and Power\n\n**Lens Formula:**\n$$\\frac{1}{v} - \\frac{1}{u} = \\frac{1}{f}$$\n\n**Magnification ($m$) for Lenses:**\n$$m = \\frac{h'}{h} = \\frac{v}{u}$$\n*(Note: Unlike mirrors, the term $\\frac{v}{u}$ is positive for lenses).*\n\n**Power of a Lens ($P$):**\nThe degree of convergence or divergence of light rays achieved by a lens. It is the reciprocal of the focal length (in meters).\n\n$$P = \\frac{1}{f(\\text{in meters})}$$\n\n*   **SI Unit:** Dioptre ($D$).\n*   $1 D = 1 m^{-1}$.\n*   Power of **Convex** lens is **Positive** ($+$).\n*   Power of **Concave** lens is **Negative** ($-$).\n\n**Power of Combination of Lenses:**\nIf multiple lenses are placed in contact:\n$$P = P_1 + P_2 + P_3 + \\dots$$\n\n[CENTER] ***End of Chapter Notes***"
