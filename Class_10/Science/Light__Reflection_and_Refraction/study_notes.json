INTRODUCTION TO LIGHT\n*   **Definition:** Light is a form of energy that enables us to see objects. It travels in straight lines.\n*   **Nature of Light:** Light exhibits a dual nature (Wave nature and Particle nature).\n*   **Speed of Light:** The speed of light in a vacuum ($c$) is $3 \\times 10^8$ m/s.\n\n---\n\n### 2. REFLECTION OF LIGHT\nThe bouncing back of light rays into the same medium when they fall on a polished, smooth surface (like a mirror) is called reflection.\n\n#### A. Laws of Reflection\n1.  The angle of incidence ($\\angle i$) is equal to the angle of reflection ($\\angle r$).\n    $$ \\angle i = \\angle r $$\n2.  The incident ray, the normal to the mirror at the point of incidence, and the reflected ray, all lie in the same plane.\n\n#### B. Image Formation by Plane Mirror\n*   **Nature:** Virtual and Erect.\n*   **Size:** Equal to the size of the object ($h = h'$).\n*   **Distance:** The image is formed as far behind the mirror as the object is in front of it ($u = v$).\n*   **Lateral Inversion:** The left side of the object appears as the right side of the image and vice versa.\n\n---\n\n### 3. SPHERICAL MIRRORS\n Mirros whose reflecting surfaces are spherical are called spherical mirrors.\n\n#### A. Types\n1.  **Concave Mirror:** The reflecting surface is curved **inwards**. It converges light rays (Converging Mirror).\n2.  **Convex Mirror:** The reflecting surface is curved **outwards**. It diverges light rays (Diverging Mirror).\n\n#### B. Important Terminology\n*   **Pole ($P$):** The center of the reflecting surface of a spherical mirror.\n*   **Center of Curvature ($C$):** The center of the sphere of which the reflecting surface is a part.\n*   **Radius of Curvature ($R$):** The distance between the Pole ($P$) and the Center of Curvature ($C$).\n*   **Principal Axis:** The straight line passing through the Pole and the Center of Curvature.\n*   **Principal Focus ($F$):**\n    *   *Concave:* The point on the principal axis where rays parallel to the axis converge.\n    *   *Convex:* The point on the principal axis where rays parallel to the axis appear to diverge from.\n*   **Focal Length ($f$):** The distance between the Pole ($P$) and the Principal Focus ($F$).\n*   **Relationship between $R$ and $f$:**\n    $$ R = 2f $$\n\n---\n\n### 4. IMAGE FORMATION BY SPHERICAL MIRRORS\n\n#### A. Rules for Ray Diagrams\n1.  **Ray parallel to Principal Axis:** Passes through Focus ($F$) (concave) or appears to diverge from $F$ (convex) after reflection.\n2.  **Ray passing through Focus ($F$):** Becomes parallel to the Principal Axis after reflection.\n3.  **Ray passing through Center of Curvature ($C$):** Retraces the same path (reflected back along the same line) because it strikes the mirror normally ($90^\\circ$).\n4.  **Ray incident obliquely at Pole ($P$):** Reflected obliquely making equal angles ($\\angle i = \\angle r$).\n\n#### B. Image Formation by Concave Mirror\n\n| Position of Object | Position of Image | Size of Image | Nature of Image |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| At Infinity | At Focus ($F$) | Highly diminished (point size) | Real and Inverted |\n| Beyond $C$ | Between $F$ and $C$ | Diminished | Real and Inverted |\n| At $C$ | At $C$ | Same size | Real and Inverted |\n| Between $C$ and $F$ | Beyond $C$ | Enlarged | Real and Inverted |\n| At $F$ | At Infinity | Highly Enlarged | Real and Inverted |\n| Between $P$ and $F$ | Behind the mirror | Enlarged | **Virtual and Erect** |\n\n#### C. Image Formation by Convex Mirror\n\n| Position of Object | Position of Image | Size of Image | Nature of Image |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| At Infinity | At Focus ($F$) behind mirror | Highly diminished (point size) | Virtual and Erect |\n| Between Infinity and $P$ | Between $P$ and $F$ behind mirror | Diminished | Virtual and Erect |\n\n---\n\n### 5. USES OF SPHERICAL MIRRORS\n\n#### Concave Mirrors\n1.  **Torches, Searchlights, Headlights:** Source placed at Focus to get a powerful parallel beam.\n2.  **Shaving/Makeup Mirrors:** Face placed between $P$ and $F$ to see an enlarged, erect image.\n3.  **Dentists:** To see large images of teeth.\n4.  **Solar Furnaces:** To concentrate sunlight at a point to produce heat.\n\n#### Convex Mirrors\n1.  **Rear-view Mirrors in Vehicles:** They always give an erect image and have a wider field of view (curved outwards).\n2.  **Security Mirrors:** In shops (to view large areas).\n\n---\n\n### 6. MIRROR FORMULA AND MAGNIFICATION\n\n#### A. New Cartesian Sign Convention\n1.  The object is always placed to the left of the mirror.\n2.  All distances are measured from the Pole ($P$).\n3.  Distances measured in the direction of incident light are **Positive (+)**.\n4.  Distances measured against the direction of incident light are **Negative (-)**.\n5.  Heights upwards (above axis) are **Positive (+)**; downwards are **Negative (-)**.\n\n*   **Concave Mirror $f$:** Negative ($-$)\n*   **Convex Mirror $f$:** Positive ($+$)\n\n#### B. Mirror Formula\n$$ \\frac{1}{v} + \\frac{1}{u} = \\frac{1}{f} $$\n*   $u$ = Object distance\n*   $v$ = Image distance\n*   $f$ = Focal length\n\n#### C. Magnification ($m$)\nRatio of height of image ($h'$) to height of object ($h$).\n$$ m = \\frac{\\text{Height of image }(h')}{\\text{Height of object }(h)} = -\\frac{v}{u} $$\n\n*   If $m$ is negative: Image is Real.\n*   If $m$ is positive: Image is Virtual.\n*   If $|m| > 1$: Image is Magnified.\n*   If $|m| < 1$: Image is Diminished.\n\n---\n\n### 7. REFRACTION OF LIGHT\nThe bending of light when it travels from one transparent medium to another is called refraction.\n\n*   **Cause:** Change in speed of light in different media.\n*   **Rare to Denser:** Light bends **towards** the normal.\n*   **Denser to Rare:** Light bends **away** from the normal.\n\n#### A. Refraction through a Rectangular Glass Slab\n*   The emergent ray is parallel to the incident ray but laterally displaced.\n*   **Lateral Displacement:** The perpendicular distance between the incident ray and the emergent ray.\n\n#### B. Laws of Refraction\n1.  The incident ray, the refracted ray, and the normal to the interface of two transparent media at the point of incidence, all lie in the same plane.\n2.  **Snell’s Law:** The ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence to the sine of the angle of refraction is a constant for the light of a given color and for the given pair of media.\n    $$ \\frac{\\sin i}{\\sin r} = \\text{constant} $$\n\n#### C. Refractive Index ($n$)\n*   **Absolute Refractive Index ($n_m$):** Ratio of speed of light in vacuum/air ($c$) to speed of light in medium ($v$).\n    $$ n_m = \\frac{c}{v} $$\n*   **Relative Refractive Index ($n_{21}$):** Refractive index of medium 2 with respect to medium 1.\n    $$ n_{21} = \\frac{\\text{Speed of light in medium 1 } (v_1)}{\\text{Speed of light in medium 2 } (v_2)} $$\n*   **Example:** Refractive index of water ($\\ce{H2O}$) is 1.33. This means the speed of light in air is 1.33 times the speed of light in water.\n*   **Optical Density:** Higher refractive index = Optically denser medium (Light travels slower).\n\n---\n\n### 8. SPHERICAL LENSES\nA transparent material bound by two surfaces, of which one or both surfaces are spherical.\n\n#### A. Types\n1.  **Convex Lens:** Thicker at the center, thinner at edges. Converging lens.\n2.  **Concave Lens:** Thinner at the center, thicker at edges. Diverging lens.\n\n#### B. Important Terminology\n*   **Optical Center ($O$):** The central point of the lens.\n*   **Principal Axis:** Line passing through the centers of curvature of the two spherical surfaces.\n*   **Principal Focus:** Lenses have two foci, represented as $F_1$ and $F_2$.\n*   **2F:** Represents the center of curvature (double the focal length). Notation used: $2F_1$ and $2F_2$.\n\n---\n\n### 9. IMAGE FORMATION BY LENSES\n\n#### A.

Lens Formula\n$$ \\frac{1}{v} - \\frac{1}{u} = \\frac{1}{f} $$\n*(Note the negative sign, unlike the mirror formula)*\n\n#### C. Magnification ($m$)\n$$ m = \\frac{h'}{h} = \\frac{v}{u} $$\n*(Note: For lenses, $v/u$ is positive)*\n\n#### D. Power of a Lens ($P$)\nThe degree of convergence or divergence of light rays achieved by a lens. It is the reciprocal of its focal length.\n$$ P = \\frac{1}{f} $$\n*   **Condition:** $f$ must be in **meters**.\n*   **SI Unit:** Dioptre ($D$).\n*   **Power of Convex Lens:** Positive ($+$).\n*   **Power of Concave Lens:** Negative ($-$).\n\n#### E. Combination of Lenses\nIf multiple lenses are placed in contact, the net power ($P$) is the algebraic sum of individual powers.\n$$ P = P_1 + P_2 + P_3 + \\dots $$"
