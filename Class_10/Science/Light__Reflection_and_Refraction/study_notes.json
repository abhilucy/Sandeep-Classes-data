Introduction to Light**\nLight is a form of energy that enables us to see objects.\n*   It travels in straight lines (Rectilinear propagation).\n*   The speed of light in a vacuum is $c = 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s.\n*   Light exhibits dual nature: Wave nature and Particle nature.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Reflection of Light**\nThe bouncing back of light rays when they strike a polished surface (like a mirror) is called reflection.\n\n**Laws of Reflection:**\n1.  The angle of incidence ($\\angle i$) is equal to the angle of reflection ($\\angle r$).\n2.  The incident ray, the normal to the mirror at the point of incidence, and the reflected ray, all lie in the same plane.\n\n[DIAGRAM: Diagram showing Laws of Reflection with incident ray, reflected ray, normal, angle i and angle r]\n\n---\n\n### **3. Spherical Mirrors**\nMirrors whose reflecting surfaces are spherical.\n\n*   **Concave Mirror:** Reflecting surface is curved inwards. It converges light rays.\n*   **Convex Mirror:** Reflecting surface is curved outwards. It diverges light rays.\n\n**Important Terms:**\n*   **Pole ($P$):** The center of the reflecting surface.\n*   **Center of Curvature ($C$):** The center of the hollow glass sphere of which the mirror is a part.\n*   **Radius of Curvature ($R$):** The distance between $P$ and $C$.\n*   **Principal Axis:** The straight line passing through $P$ and $C$.\n*   **Principal Focus ($F$):** The point on the principal axis where rays parallel to the axis converge (concave) or appear to diverge from (convex).\n*   **Focal Length ($f$):** The distance between the Pole ($P$) and the Principal Focus ($F$).\n\n**Relationship between Radius of Curvature and Focal Length:**\n$$R = 2f$$\n\n[DIAGRAM: Terminology of Spherical Mirrors indicating P, C, F, f, and R for both Concave and Convex mirrors]\n\n---\n\n### **4. Image Formation by Spherical Mirrors**\n\n#### **Rules for Ray Tracing:**\n1.  A ray parallel to the principal axis passes through $F$ (concave) or appears to diverge from $F$ (convex) after reflection.\n2.  A ray passing through $F$ (concave) or directed towards $F$ (convex) becomes parallel to the principal axis.\n3.  A ray passing through $C$ is reflected back along the same path.\n4.  A ray incident obliquely to the principal axis towards $P$ is reflected obliquely making equal angles.\n\n#### **Image Formation by Concave Mirror:**\n| Position of Object ($u$) | Position of Image ($v$) | Size of Image | Nature of Image |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| At infinity | At $F$ | Highly diminished (point size) | Real and Inverted |\n| Beyond $C$ | Between $F$ and $C$ | Diminished | Real and Inverted |\n| At $C$ | At $C$ | Same size | Real and Inverted |\n| Between $C$ and $F$ | Beyond $C$ | Enlarged | Real and Inverted |\n| At $F$ | At infinity | Highly enlarged | Real and Inverted |\n| Between $P$ and $F$ | Behind the mirror | Enlarged | Virtual and Erect |\n\n[DIAGRAM: Six cases of Ray diagrams for image formation by Concave Mirror]\n\n#### **Image Formation by Convex Mirror:**\n| Position of Object ($u$) | Position of Image ($v$) | Size of Image | Nature of Image |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| At infinity | At $F$ (behind mirror) | Highly diminished | Virtual and Erect |\n| Between infinity and $P$ | Between $P$ and $F$ (behind mirror) | Diminished | Virtual and Erect |\n\n[DIAGRAM: Two cases of Ray diagrams for image formation by Convex Mirror]\n\n---\n\n### **5. Mirror Formula and Magnification**\n\n**New Cartesian Sign Convention:**\n*   The object is always placed to the left of the mirror.\n*   All distances parallel to the principal axis are measured from the Pole ($P$).\n*   Distances measured in the direction of incident light are positive (+).\n*   Distances measured against the direction of incident light are negative (-).\n*   Distances measured upwards from the principal axis are positive (+).\n*   Distances measured downwards are negative (-).\n\n**Mirror Formula:**\nWhere $v$ is image distance, $u$ is object distance, and $f$ is focal length:\n$$\\frac{1}{v} + \\frac{1}{u} = \\frac{1}{f}$$\n\n**Magnification ($m$):**\nMagnification gives the relative extent to which the image is magnified with respect to the object size.\n$$m = \\frac{\\text{Height of image }(h')}{\\text{Height of object }(h)} = -\\frac{v}{u}$$\n\n*   If $m$ is negative: Image is Real.\n*   If $m$ is positive: Image is Virtual.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Refraction of Light**\nRefraction is the bending of light when it travels from one transparent medium to another.\n\n*   **Rare to Denser Medium:** Light bends **towards** the normal.\n*   **Denser to Rare Medium:** Light bends **away from** the normal.\n\n**Refraction through a Rectangular Glass Slab:**\nThe incident ray and the emergent ray are parallel to each other, but the emergent ray is laterally shifted. This perpendicular distance is called **Lateral Displacement**.\n\n[DIAGRAM: Refraction through a rectangular glass slab showing incident ray, refracted ray, emergent ray, and lateral displacement]\n\n---\n\n### **7. Laws of Refraction**\n\n1.  The incident ray, the refracted ray, and the normal to the interface of two transparent media at the point of incidence, all lie in the same plane.\n2.  **Snell’s Law:** The ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence to the sine of the angle of refraction is a constant for the light of a given color and for the given pair of media.\n    $$\\frac{\\sin i}{\\sin r} = \\text{constant}$$\n\n**Refractive Index ($n$):**\nThe constant in Snell's law is the refractive index of the second medium with respect to the first.\n\n**Relative Refractive Index ($n_{21}$):**\n$$n_{21} = \\frac{\\text{Speed of light in medium 1 } (v_1)}{\\text{Speed of light in medium 2 } (v_2)}$$\n\n**Absolute Refractive Index ($n_m$):**\nIf medium 1 is vacuum or air, the refractive index of medium 2 ($n_m$) is considered absolute.\n$$n_m = \\frac{c}{v}$$\n*(Where $c = 3 \\times 10^8$ m/s)*\n\n*   Higher Refractive Index = Optically Denser Medium (Speed of light is slower).\n*   Lower Refractive Index = Optically Rarer Medium (Speed of light is faster).\n\n---\n\n### **8. Spherical Lenses**\n\n*   **Convex Lens:** Thicker at the middle, thinner at edges. Converging lens.\n*   **Concave Lens:** Thinner at the middle, thicker at edges. Diverging lens.\n\n**Terminology:**\n*   Optical Centre ($O$): Central point of the lens.\n*   Principal Focus ($F$): Point where parallel rays converge (convex) or appear to diverge (concave). Lenses have two foci ($F_1, F_2$).\n\n[DIAGRAM: Terminology of Spherical Lenses showing O, F1, F2, 2F1, 2F2]\n\n#### **Image Formation by Convex Lens:**\n| Position of Object ($u$) | Position of Image ($v$) | Size of Image | Nature of Image |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| At infinity | At $F_2$ | Highly diminished | Real and Inverted |\n| Beyond $2F_1$ | Between $F_2$ and $2F_2$ | Diminished | Real and Inverted |\n| At $2F_1$ | At $2F_2$ | Same size | Real and Inverted |\n| Between $F_1$ and $2F_1$ | Beyond $2F_2$ | Enlarged | Real and Inverted |\n| At $F_1$ | At infinity | Highly enlarged | Real and Inverted |\n| Between $F_1$ and $O$ | On same side as object | Enlarged | Virtual and Erect |\n\n[DIAGRAM: Ray diagrams for image formation by Convex Lens]\n\n#### **Image Formation by Concave Lens:**\n| Position of Object ($u$) | Position of Image ($v$) | Size of Image | Nature of Image |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| At infinity | At $F_1$ | Highly diminished | Virtual and Erect |\n| Between infinity and $O$ | Between $F_1$ and $O$ | Diminished | Virtual and Erect |\n\n[DIAGRAM: Ray diagrams for image formation by Concave Lens]\n\n---\n\n### **9. Lens Formula and Magnification**\n\n**Lens Formula:**\nRelates object distance ($u$), image distance ($v$), and focal length ($f$):\n$$\\frac{1}{v} - \\frac{1}{u} = \\frac{1}{f}$$\n\n*Note the negative sign in the lens formula compared to the mirror formula.*\n\n**Magnification ($m$):**\n$$m = \\frac{h'}{h} = \\frac{v}{u}$$\n\n*   **Sign Convention for Lenses:**\n    *   $f$ is positive ($+$) for Convex Lens.\n    *   $f$ is negative ($-$) for Concave Lens.\n\n---\n\n### **10. Power of a Lens ($P$)**\nThe ability of a lens to converge or diverge light rays. It is defined as the reciprocal of the focal length.\n\n**Formula:**\n$$P = \\frac{1}{f}$$\n*(Note: $f$ must be in meters)*\n\n**Unit:** Dioptre ($D$).\n*   $1 D = 1 m^{-1}$.\n*   Power of Convex lens is Positive ($+$).\n*   Power of Concave lens is Negative ($-$).\n\n**Power of Combination of Lenses:**\nIf multiple lenses are placed in contact, the total power $P$ is the algebraic sum of individual powers:\n$$P = P_1 + P_2 + P_3 + \\dots$$"
