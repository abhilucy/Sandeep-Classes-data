Reflection of Light**\nReflection is the bouncing back of light when it strikes a polished surface like a mirror.\n\n**Laws of Reflection:**\n1. The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection ($\\angle i = \\angle r$).\n2. The incident ray, the normal to the mirror at the point of incidence, and the reflected ray, all lie in the same plane.\n\n[DIAGRAM: Reflection of light on a plane mirror showing incident ray, reflected ray, normal, angle i, and angle r]\n\n---\n\n### **2. Spherical Mirrors**\nMirrors whose reflecting surfaces are spherical are called spherical mirrors.\n\n*   **Concave Mirror:** Reflecting surface is curved inwards. (Converging mirror)\n*   **Convex Mirror:** Reflecting surface is curved outwards. (Diverging mirror)\n\n**Important Terms:**\n*   **Pole ($P$):** The center of the reflecting surface.\n*   **Center of Curvature ($C$):** The center of the hollow glass sphere of which the mirror is a part.\n*   **Principal Axis:** The straight line passing through the pole and the center of curvature.\n*   **Principal Focus ($F$):** The point where rays parallel to the principal axis converge (concave) or appear to diverge from (convex).\n*   **Focal Length ($f$):** The distance between the pole ($P$) and the principal focus ($F$).\n\n**Relationship between Radius of Curvature ($R$) and Focal Length ($f$):**\n$$R = 2f$$\n\n[DIAGRAM: Ray diagrams showing Focus and Center of Curvature for both Concave and Convex mirrors]\n\n---\n\n### **3. Mirror Formula and Magnification**\n\nTo calculate the position and nature of the image formed by a mirror, we use the Mirror Formula.\n\n**The Mirror Formula:**\n$$\\frac{1}{v} + \\frac{1}{u} = \\frac{1}{f}$$\n\nWhere:\n*   $u$ = Object distance\n*   $v$ = Image distance\n*   $f$ = Focal length\n\n**Magnification ($m$):**\nMagnification gives the relative extent to which an image is magnified with respect to the object size.\n\n$$m = \\frac{\\text{Height of the image } (h')}{\\text{Height of the object } (h)}$$\n\nIn terms of image and object distances:\n$$m = -\\frac{v}{u}$$\n\n**Sign Convention Summary:**\n*   Object distance $u$ is always negative.\n*   Concave mirror $f$ is negative.\n*   Convex mirror $f$ is positive.\n\n[DIAGRAM: Cartesian Sign Convention for Spherical Mirrors]\n\n---\n\n### **4. Refraction of Light**\nRefraction is the bending of light as it passes from one transparent medium to another.\n\n*   **Rare to Denser Medium:** Light bends **towards** the normal.\n*   **Denser to Rare Medium:** Light bends **away from** the normal.\n\n[DIAGRAM: Refraction of light through a rectangular glass slab showing lateral displacement]\n\n**Laws of Refraction:**\n1.  The incident ray, the refracted ray, and the normal to the interface of two transparent media at the point of incidence, all lie in the same plane.\n2.  **Snell’s Law:** The ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence to the sine of the angle of refraction is a constant.\n    $$\\frac{\\sin i}{\\sin r} = \\text{constant}$$\n\n---\n\n### **5. Refractive Index ($n$)**\nThe refractive index measures the speed of light in a medium relative to another.\n\n**Absolute Refractive Index ($n_m$):**\n$$n_m = \\frac{\\text{Speed of light in air } (c)}{\\text{Speed of light in the medium } (v)}$$\n\n**Relative Refractive Index ($n_{21}$):**\nRefractive index of medium 2 with respect to medium 1:\n$$n_{21} = \\frac{\\text{Speed of light in medium 1 } (v_1)}{\\text{Speed of light in medium 2 } (v_2)}$$\n\n---\n\n### **6. Spherical Lenses**\n*   **Convex Lens:** Thicker at the center than at the edges. (Converging lens)\n*   **Concave Lens:** Thinner at the center than at the edges. (Diverging lens)\n\n[DIAGRAM: Image formation by Convex Lens for various object positions]\n[DIAGRAM: Image formation by Concave Lens]\n\n---\n\n### **7. Lens Formula and Magnification**\n\n**The Lens Formula:**\n$$\\frac{1}{v} - \\frac{1}{u} = \\frac{1}{f}$$\n\nWhere:\n*   $u$ = Object distance\n*   $v$ = Image distance\n*   $f$ = Focal length\n\n**Magnification ($m$):**\n$$m = \\frac{h'}{h} = \\frac{v}{u}$$\n\n*(Note: Unlike mirrors, the formula for lenses uses positive $v/u$)*\n\n---\n\n### **8. Power of a Lens ($P$)**\nThe power of a lens is defined as the reciprocal of its focal length. It represents the degree of convergence or divergence.\n\n$$P = \\frac{1}{f}$$\n\n*   $f$ must be in meters.\n*   **SI Unit:** Dioptre (D).\n*   Power of a Convex lens is Positive (+).\n*   Power of a Concave lens is Negative (-).\n\n**Power of Combination of Lenses:**\nIf multiple lenses are placed in contact, the net power $P$ is the algebraic sum of individual powers:\n$$P = P_1 + P_2 + P_3 + \\dots$$"
