      "Tetravalency",
      "Catenation",
      "High electronegativity",
      "Isomerism"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Catenation is the unique ability of carbon to form long chains or rings by bonding with other carbon atoms. Tetravalency refers to having 4 valence electrons, but catenation specifically explains the self-linking property. Electronegativity is moderate for carbon, and isomerism is a result of these properties, not the cause.",
