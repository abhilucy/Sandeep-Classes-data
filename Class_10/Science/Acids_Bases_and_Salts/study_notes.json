Chemical Properties of Acids and Bases\n\n### 2.1 Reaction of Metals with Acids and Bases\n\nWhen an acid reacts with a metal, it displaces hydrogen from the acid. This is observed as the evolution of hydrogen gas.\n\n**General Equation:**\n$\\text{Acid} + \\text{Metal} \\rightarrow \\text{Salt} + \\text{Hydrogen Gas}$\n\n**Example:**\n$\\ce{2HCl(aq) + Zn(s) -> ZnCl2(aq) + H2(g)}$\n$\\ce{H2SO4(aq) + Zn(s) -> ZnSO4(aq) + H2(g)}$\n\n**Testing Hydrogen Gas (Pop Test):**\nBring a burning candle near the gas bubbles. Hydrogen gas burns with a characteristic \"pop\" sound.\n\n**Reaction with Bases:**\nMetals like Zinc and Aluminium react with strong bases to evolve hydrogen gas.\n$\\ce{2NaOH(aq) + Zn(s) -> Na2ZnO2(aq) + H2(g)}$\n*(Note: $\\ce{Na2ZnO2}$ is Sodium Zincate)*. This reaction is not possible with all metals.\n\n[DIAGRAM: Setup for reaction of Zinc granules with dilute Sulphuric acid. Show a stand, a test tube containing zinc and acid, a delivery tube passing gas into a soap solution, and bubbles filled with hydrogen gas bursting with a flame.]\n\n### 2.2 Reaction with Metal Carbonates and Hydrogen Carbonates\n\nAcids react with metal carbonates and metal hydrogen carbonates (bicarbonates) to give corresponding salt, carbon dioxide, and water.\n\n**General Equation:**\n$\\text{Metal Carbonate/Bicarbonate} + \\text{Acid} \\rightarrow \\text{Salt} + \\ce{CO2} + \\ce{H2O}$\n\n**Examples:**\n1.  **Sodium Carbonate:**\n    $\\ce{Na2CO3(s) + 2HCl(aq) -> 2NaCl(aq) + H2O(l) + CO2(g)}$\n2.  **Sodium Hydrogen Carbonate:**\n    $\\ce{NaHCO3(s) + HCl(aq) -> NaCl(aq) + H2O(l) + CO2(g)}$\n\n**Lime Water Test for $\\ce{CO2}$:**\nOn passing the gas evolved through lime water ($\\ce{Ca(OH)2}$), it turns milky due to the formation of Calcium Carbonate.\n$\\ce{Ca(OH)2(aq) + CO2(g) -> CaCO3(s) + H2O(l)}$\n\nIf excess $\\ce{CO2}$ is passed, the milkiness disappears due to the formation of soluble Calcium Hydrogen Carbonate:\n$\\ce{CaCO3(s) + H2O(l) + CO2(g) -> Ca(HCO3)2(aq)}$\n\n*Note: Bases do not react with metal carbonates or metal hydrogen carbonates.*\n\n[DIAGRAM: Experimental setup showing a thistle funnel adding HCl to Sodium Carbonate in a flask. A delivery tube leads into a test tube containing Lime Water, which is turning milky.]\n\n### 2.3 Reaction of Acids and Bases with Each Other (Neutralization)\n\nThe reaction between an acid and a base to give a salt and water is known as a neutralization reaction. The base nullifies the effect of the acid and vice versa.\n\n**General Equation:**\n$\\text{Base} + \\text{Acid} \\rightarrow \\text{Salt} + \\text{Water}$\n\n**Example:**\n$\\ce{NaOH(aq) + HCl(aq) -> NaCl(aq) + H2O(l)}$\n\n### 2.4 Reaction of Metallic Oxides with Acids\n\nMetallic oxides are generally **basic oxides**. They react with acids to form salt and water.\n\n**Example:**\n$\\ce{CuO(s) + 2HCl(aq) -> CuCl2(aq) + H2O(l)}$\n*(Copper (II) oxide is black; Copper (II) chloride is blue-green).*\n\n### 2.5 Reaction of Non-Metallic Oxides with Bases\n\nNon-metallic oxides are generally **acidic oxides** (e.g., $\\ce{CO2}, \\ce{SO2}$). They react with bases to form salt and water.\n\n**Example:**\n$\\ce{Ca(OH)2(aq) + CO2(g) -> CaCO3(s) + H2O(l)}$\n\n[DIAGRAM: A flowchart summarizing chemical properties. Central node 'Acids', connecting to nodes: '+ Metal = H2', '+ Carbonate = CO2', '+ Base = Salt+Water', '+ Metal Oxide = Salt+Water'.]\n\n---\n\n# 3. Acids and Bases in Water Solution\n\n### What happens to an Acid in water?\nAcids produce hydrogen ions $\\ce{H+(aq)}$ only in the presence of water. The $\\ce{H+}$ ions cannot exist alone; they combine with water molecules to form Hydronium ions ($\\ce{H3O+}$).\n\n$\\ce{HCl + H2O -> H3O+ + Cl-}$\n\n### What happens to a Base in water?\nBases generate hydroxide ions $\\ce{OH-(aq)}$ in water. Bases which are soluble in water are called **Alkalis**.\n\n$\\ce{NaOH(s) ->[H2O] Na+(aq) + OH-(aq)}$\n$\\ce{Mg(OH)2(s) ->[H2O] Mg^2+(aq) + 2OH-(aq)}$\n\n### Process of Dilution\nThe process of dissolving an acid or a base in water is a highly **exothermic** one.\n\n*   **Correct Method:** Always add **Acid to Water** slowly with constant stirring.\n*   **Incorrect Method:** Never add Water to Acid. This may cause the mixture to splash out and cause burns, or the glass container may break due to excessive local heating.\n\n**Dilution:** Mixing an acid or base with water results in a decrease in the concentration of ions ($\\ce{H3O+}$ or $\\ce{OH-}$) per unit volume.\n\n[DIAGRAM: Illustration showing two beakers. One marked with a red 'X' showing water being poured into concentrated acid (Dangerous). The other marked with a green checkmark showing acid being dropped slowly into water with a stirring rod.]\n\n---\n\n# 4. Strength of Acids and Bases: The pH Scale\n\nThe strength of an acid or base depends on the number of $\\ce{H+}$ ions or $\\ce{OH-}$ ions produced.\n\n**The pH Scale:** A scale for measuring hydrogen ion concentration in a solution.\n*   $p$ in pH stands for 'potenz' in German, meaning power.\n*   Range: $0$ (very acidic) to $14$ (very alkaline).\n*   **Neutral:** $pH = 7$ (e.g., pure water).\n*   **Acidic:** $pH < 7$.\n*   **Basic:** $pH > 7$.\n\n| pH Value | Nature of Solution | Ion Concentration |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| $0 - 2$ | Strong Acid | Very High $[\\ce{H+}]$ |\n| $3 - 6$ | Weak Acid | Moderate $[\\ce{H+}]$ |\n| $7$ | Neutral | $[\\ce{H+}] = [\\ce{OH-}]$ |\n| $8 - 11$ | Weak Base | Moderate $[\\ce{OH-}]$ |\n| $12 - 14$ | Strong Base | Very High $[\\ce{OH-}]$ |\n\n[DIAGRAM: A horizontal color gradient bar representing the pH scale. Red/Orange on the left (0-6), Green in the middle (7), and Blue/Purple on the right (8-14). Label common substances: Battery Acid (0), Lemon Juice (2), Water (7), Soap (10), Bleach (13).]\n\n---\n\n# 5. Importance of pH in Everyday Life\n\n**1. Plants and Animals are pH Sensitive:**\n*   Our body works within the pH range of $7.0$ to $7.8$.\n*   **Acid Rain:** When pH of rain water is less than $5.6$, it is called acid rain. It lowers the pH of river water, endangering aquatic life.\n\n**2. pH in our Soil:**\n*   Plants require a specific pH range for healthy growth. If soil is too acidic, farmers treat it with Quick lime ($\\ce{CaO}$) or Slaked lime ($\\ce{Ca(OH)2}$).\n\n**3. pH in our Digestive System:**\n*   Our stomach produces **Hydrochloric acid ($\\ce{HCl}$)** to help digestion.\n*   During indigestion, excess acid causes pain. **Antacids** (mild bases like Milk of Magnesia $\\ce{Mg(OH)2}$) are used to neutralize the excess acid.\n\n**4. pH Change as the cause of Tooth Decay:**\n*   Tooth decay starts when the pH of the mouth is lower than $5.5$.\n*   Bacteria degrade sugar and food particles to produce acids. Toothpastes are generally basic and neutralize this acid.\n\n**5. Self-Defense by Animals and Plants:**\n*   **Bee sting:** Leaves an acid (Methanoic acid) which causes pain. Use a mild base like baking soda for relief.\n*   **Nettle leaves:** Have stinging hair which inject methanoic acid. Dock plant (basic nature) often grows nearby and provides relief.\n\n[DIAGRAM: Illustration showing a human stomach with acid, a decaying tooth cross-section, and a Nettle leaf with stinging hairs.]\n\n---\n\n# 6. Salts\n\nSalts are formed by the neutralization reaction of acid and base.\n*   **Strong Acid + Strong Base** $\\rightarrow$ Neutral Salt ($pH = 7$) e.g., $\\ce{NaCl}, \\ce{K2SO4}$.\n*   **Strong Acid + Weak Base** $\\rightarrow$ Acidic Salt ($pH < 7$) e.g., $\\ce{NH4Cl}$.\n*   **Weak Acid + Strong Base** $\\rightarrow$ Basic Salt ($pH > 7$) e.g., $\\ce{Na2CO3}$.\n\n---\n\n# 7. Chemicals from Common Salt ($\\ce{NaCl}$)\n\nCommon salt is an important raw material for various materials of daily use.\n\n### 7.1 Sodium Hydroxide ($\\ce{NaOH}$) | Chlor-Alkali Process\nWhen electricity is passed through an aqueous solution of sodium chloride (called **brine**), it decomposes to form sodium hydroxide.\n\n**Reaction:**\n$\\ce{2NaCl(aq) + 2H2O(l) -> 2NaOH(aq) + Cl2(g) + H2(g)}$\n\n**Products formed:**\n1.  **Chlorine ($\\ce{Cl2}$):** At Anode (+). Uses: Water treatment, PVC, CFCs, pesticides.\n2.  **Hydrogen ($\\ce{H2}$):** At Cathode (-). Uses: Fuels, margarine, ammonia for fertilizers.\n3.  **Sodium Hydroxide ($\\ce{NaOH}$):** Near Cathode. Uses: Soaps, detergents, paper making, artificial fibers.\n\n[DIAGRAM: Schematic of the Chlor-Alkali cell. Show a tank with brine inlet.

It is produced using Sodium Chloride.\n\n**Reaction:**\n$\\ce{NaCl + H2O + CO2 + NH3 -> NH4Cl + NaHCO3}$\n\n**Properties:**\n*   It is a mild non-corrosive basic salt.\n*   On heating during cooking:\n    $\\ce{2NaHCO3 ->[\\Delta] Na2CO3 + H2O + CO2}$\n\n**Uses:**\n1.  **Making Baking Powder:** A mixture of Baking Soda and a mild edible acid (Tartaric acid).\n    *   $\\ce{NaHCO3 + H+ \\text{(from acid)} -> CO2 + H2O + \\text{Sodium salt of acid}}$.\n    *   The $\\ce{CO2}$ produced causes bread/cake to rise, making them soft and spongy.\n2.  Ingredient in antacids (neutralizes stomach acid).\n3.  Used in soda-acid fire extinguishers.\n\n### 7.4 Washing Soda ($\\ce{Na2CO3.10H2O}$)\nRecrystallization of sodium carbonate gives washing soda.\n\n**Reaction:**\n$\\ce{Na2CO3 + 10H2O -> Na2CO3.10H2O}$\n\n**Uses:**\n*   Glass, soap, and paper industries.\n*   Manufacture of sodium compounds like Borax.\n*   Cleaning agent for domestic purposes.\n*   Removing **permanent hardness** of water.\n\n### 7.5 Plaster of Paris (POP) ($\\ce{CaSO4.\\frac{1}{2}H2O}$)\nOn heating Gypsum ($\\ce{CaSO4.2H2O}$) at $373 K$, it loses water molecules and becomes Calcium Sulphate Hemihydrate.\n\n**Reaction:**\n$\\ce{CaSO4.2H2O ->[\\Delta (373 K)] CaSO4.\\frac{1}{2}H2O + 1\\frac{1}{2}H2O}$\n\n**Uses:**\n*   Doctors use it for supporting fractured bones in the right position.\n*   Making toys, materials for decoration.\n*   Making surfaces smooth.\n\n**Setting of POP:** When mixed with water, it changes to gypsum once again giving a hard solid mass.\n$\\ce{CaSO4.\\frac{1}{2}H2O + 1\\frac{1}{2}H2O -> CaSO4.2H2O}$\n\n[DIAGRAM: Images of a fractured arm with a cast (POP) and a crystal structure comparison of Gypsum vs. POP.]\n\n---\n\n# 8. Water of Crystallization\n\nAre crystals of salts really dry? No.\n**Water of crystallization** is the fixed number of water molecules present in one formula unit of a salt.\n\n**Example: Copper Sulphate ($\\ce{CuSO4.5H2O}$)**\n*   Hydrated Copper Sulphate is **Blue**.\n*   When heated, it loses water molecules and becomes anhydrous copper sulphate, which is **White**.\n    $\\ce{CuSO4.5H2O(Blue) ->[\\Delta] CuSO4(White) + 5H2O}$\n*   If you moisten the white powder, the blue color reappears.\n\n**Other Examples:**\n*   Washing Soda: $\\ce{Na2CO3.10H2O}$ ($10$ molecules of water).\n*   Gypsum: $\\ce{CaSO4.2H2O}$ ($2$ molecules of water).\n\n[DIAGRAM: A test tube being heated in a burner flame containing blue copper sulphate crystals.
