Introduction to Acids and Bases\n\nSubstances are classified as acids or bases based on their chemical properties and their behavior with indicators.\n\n### Properties of Acids\n*   **Taste:** Sour.\n*   **Litmus Test:** Change blue litmus to red.\n*   **Aqueous Solution:** Dissociate to yield $\\ce{H+}$ ions (protons).\n*   **Examples:** Hydrochloric acid ($\\ce{HCl}$), Sulphuric acid ($\\ce{H2SO4}$), Acetic acid ($\\ce{CH3COOH}$).\n\n### Properties of Bases\n*   **Taste:** Bitter.\n*   **Touch:** Soapy to touch.\n*   **Litmus Test:** Change red litmus to blue.\n*   **Aqueous Solution:** Dissociate to yield $\\ce{OH-}$ ions (hydroxyl ions).\n*   **Examples:** Sodium hydroxide ($\\ce{NaOH}$), Calcium hydroxide ($\\ce{Ca(OH)2}$).\n\n### Indicators\nIndicators are substances that change color or odor in the presence of an acid or a base.\n\n1.  **Natural Indicators:**\n    *   **Litmus:** Extracted from Lichen. Purple in neutral solution.\n    *   **Turmeric:** Yellow in acid/neutral, turns reddish-brown in base.\n2.  **Synthetic Indicators:**\n    *   **Methyl Orange:** Red in acid, yellow in base.\n    *   **Phenolphthalein:** Colorless in acid, pink in base.\n3.  **Olfactory Indicators:** Substances whose odour changes in acidic or basic media (e.g., vanilla, onion, clove oil).\n\n[DIAGRAM: A table showing color changes of Litmus, Phenolphthalein, and Methyl Orange in Acidic, Basic, and Neutral solutions.]\n\n### Conclusion\nAcids and bases are fundamental chemical classifications defined by their specific ion release in water and distinctive color changes with indicators. Understanding these basic properties is the first step in analyzing chemical behavior.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Chemical Properties of Acids and Bases\n\n### Reaction with Metals\nAcids react with active metals to liberate hydrogen gas and form a corresponding salt.\n$$ \\text{Acid} + \\text{Metal} \\rightarrow \\text{Salt} + \\text{Hydrogen Gas} $$\n\n**Example:** Zinc granules reacting with dilute sulphuric acid.\n$$ \\ce{Zn(s) + H2SO4(aq) -> ZnSO4(aq) + H2(g)} $$\n\n*Note:* Bases also react with some metals (like Zinc and Aluminium) to produce hydrogen gas.\n$$ \\ce{2NaOH(aq) + Zn(s) -> Na2ZnO2(aq) (Sodium Zincate) + H2(g)} $$\n\n[DIAGRAM: Setup showing a test tube with Zinc granules and dilute Sulphuric acid, with a delivery tube leading to a soap solution bowl. Bubbles of Hydrogen gas rise and burn with a 'pop' sound when a candle is brought near.]\n\n### Reaction with Metal Carbonates and Metal Hydrogen Carbonates\nAcids react with metal carbonates or bicarbonates to produce salt, carbon dioxide gas, and water.\n$$ \\text{Metal Carbonate/Bicarbonate} + \\text{Acid} \\rightarrow \\text{Salt} + \\ce{CO2} + \\ce{H2O} $$\n\n**Example:**\n$$ \\ce{Na2CO3(s) + 2HCl(aq) -> 2NaCl(aq) + H2O(l) + CO2(g)} $$\n$$ \\ce{NaHCO3(s) + HCl(aq) -> NaCl(aq) + H2O(l) + CO2(g)} $$\n\n**Test for $\\ce{CO2}$:** Passing the gas through lime water ($\\ce{Ca(OH)2}$).\n$$ \\ce{Ca(OH)2(aq) + CO2(g) -> CaCO3(s) (White precipitate) + H2O(l)} $$\nIf excess $\\ce{CO2}$ is passed, the precipitate dissolves:\n$$ \\ce{CaCO3(s) + H2O(l) + CO2(g) -> Ca(HCO3)2(aq) (Soluble)} $$\n\n### Neutralization Reaction\nThe reaction between an acid and a base to give a salt and water is known as a neutralization reaction.\n$$ \\text{Base} + \\text{Acid} \\rightarrow \\text{Salt} + \\text{Water} $$\n$$ \\ce{NaOH(aq) + HCl(aq) -> NaCl(aq) + H2O(l)} $$\n\n### Reaction of Metallic Oxides with Acids\nMetallic oxides are basic in nature. They react with acids to form salt and water.\n$$ \\text{Metal Oxide} + \\text{Acid} \\rightarrow \\text{Salt} + \\text{Water} $$\n**Example:** Copper(II) oxide reacting with hydrochloric acid.\n$$ \\ce{CuO(s) + 2HCl(aq) -> CuCl2(aq) (Blue-green color) + H2O(l)} $$\n\n### Reaction of Non-Metallic Oxides with Bases\nNon-metallic oxides are acidic in nature. They react with bases to form salt and water.\n$$ \\ce{Ca(OH)2(aq) + CO2(g) -> CaCO3(s) + H2O(l)} $$\n\n### Conclusion\nChemical properties reveal that acids and bases generally react to neutralize each other. Acids liberate hydrogen with metals and carbon dioxide with carbonates, while metallic oxides behave as bases and non-metallic oxides behave as acids.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Acids and Bases in Water Solution\n\n### What Happens to an Acid in Water Solution?\nAcids produce hydrogen ions ($\\ce{H+}$) only in the presence of water. $\\ce{H+}$ ions cannot exist alone; they combine with water molecules to form hydronium ions ($\\ce{H3O+}$).\n\n$$ \\ce{HCl + H2O -> H3O+ + Cl-} $$\n\n### What Happens to a Base in Water Solution?\nBases generate hydroxide ions ($\\ce{OH-}$) in water. Bases which are soluble in water are called **Alkalis**.\n\n$$ \\ce{NaOH(s) ->[H2O] Na+(aq) + OH-(aq)} $$\n$$ \\ce{Mg(OH)2(s) ->[H2O] Mg^{2+}(aq) + 2OH-(aq)} $$\n\n[DIAGRAM: Illustration of the conduction of electricity through an acidic solution showing ions moving towards electrodes, lighting up a bulb in the circuit.]\n\n### Dilution\nThe process of dissolving an acid or a base in water is highly exothermic (releases heat).\n*   **Rule:** Always add **Acid to Water** slowly with constant stirring.\n*   **Never add Water to Acid:** This may cause the mixture to splash out and cause burns due to excessive local heating.\n*   **Definition:** Mixing an acid or base with water results in a decrease in the concentration of ions ($\\ce{H3O+}$/$\\ce{OH-}$) per unit volume. This is called dilution.\n\n### Conclusion\nWater is the essential medium that allows acids and bases to display their properties by facilitating ionization. The formation of $\\ce{H3O+}$ and $\\ce{OH-}$ ions is responsible for the acidic and basic characteristics, respectively.\n\n---\n\n## 4. The pH Scale: Strength of Acid and Base Solutions\n\nThe strength of an acid or base depends on the number of $\\ce{H+}$ or $\\ce{OH-}$ ions produced. We use a universal indicator or the pH scale to measure this.\n*   **pH:** The $p$ stands for 'potenz' (German for power). It measures the concentration of hydrogen ions.\n*   **Range:** $0$ (very acidic) to $14$ (very alkaline).\n*   **Neutral:** $pH = 7$ (Water).\n*   **Acidic:** $pH < 7$.\n*   **Basic:** $pH > 7$.\n\n[DIAGRAM: A horizontal color strip representing the pH scale from 0 to 14. 0 is dark red, 7 is green, 14 is dark violet/blue.]\n\n### Importance of pH in Everyday Life\n1.  **Sensitivity of Plants and Animals:** Our body works within the pH range of $7.0$ to $7.8$. Living organisms can survive only in a narrow range of pH change. Acid rain occurs when rain pH is $< 5.6$.\n2.  **Soil pH:** Plants require a specific pH range for healthy growth. If soil is too acidic, farmers treat it with Quick lime ($\\ce{CaO}$) or Slaked lime ($\\ce{Ca(OH)2}$).\n3.  **Digestive System:** Our stomach produces $\\ce{HCl}$ ($pH \\approx 1.2$) to help digestion. Excess acid causes pain (acidity), treated with Antacids (mild bases like $\\ce{Mg(OH)2}$).\n4.  **Tooth Decay:** Starts when the pH of the mouth is lower than $5.5$. Bacteria degrade sugar to produce acid, corroding enamel ($\\ce{Ca3(PO4)2}$).\n5.  **Self Defense:** Bee stings leave an acid (Methanoic acid) causing pain. Applying mild base like baking soda provides relief. Nettle leaves inject methanoic acid; dock plant (basic nature) usually grows nearby as a remedy.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe pH scale provides a quantitative method to determine the strength of acids and bases. It plays a critical role in biological processes, agriculture, and daily health maintenance.\n\n---\n\n## 5. More About Salts\n\nSalts are formed by the neutralization reaction between acids and bases.\n\n### Family of Salts\nSalts having the same positive or negative radicals belong to the same family.\n*   **Sodium Salts:** $\\ce{NaCl}, \\ce{Na2SO4}$.\n*   **Chloride Salts:** $\\ce{NaCl}, \\ce{KCl}$.\n\n### pH of Salts\n1.  **Strong Acid + Strong Base $\\rightarrow$ Neutral Salt ($pH = 7$):** e.g., $\\ce{NaCl}, \\ce{K2SO4}$.\n2.  **Strong Acid + Weak Base $\\rightarrow$ Acidic Salt ($pH < 7$):** e.g., $\\ce{NH4Cl}$.\n3.  **Weak Acid + Strong Base $\\rightarrow$ Basic Salt ($pH > 7$):** e.g., $\\ce{CH3COONa}$.\n\n### Conclusion\nSalts are not always neutral. Their pH depends on the relative strength of the parent acid and base used during neutralization.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Chemicals from Common Salt ($\\ce{NaCl}$)\n\nCommon salt is a raw material for various chemicals.\n\n### 1. Sodium Hydroxide ($\\ce{NaOH}$)\n*   **Process:** Chlor-alkali process.\n*   **Method:** Electricity is passed through an aqueous solution of $\\ce{NaCl}$ (brine).\n*   **Reaction:**\n    $$ \\ce{2NaCl(aq) + 2H2O(l) -> 2NaOH(aq) + Cl2(g) + H2(g)} $$\n*   **Products:**\n    *   $\\ce{Cl2}$ (Anode): Water treatment, PVC, CFCs.\n    *   $\\ce{H2}$ (Cathode): Fuels, ammonia for fertilizers.\n    *   $\\ce{NaOH}$ (Near Cathode): De-greasing metals, soaps, paper making.\n\n[DIAGRAM: Schematic of a Chlor-alkali cell showing Anode (+), Cathode (-), membrane, and the separation of Chlorine gas, Hydrogen gas, and Sodium Hydroxide solution.]\n\n### 2. Bleaching Powder ($\\ce{CaOCl2}$)\n*   **Preparation:** Action of chlorine on dry slaked lime ($\\ce{Ca(OH)2}$).\n*   **Reaction:**\n    $$ \\ce{Ca(OH)2 + Cl2 -> CaOCl2 + H2O} $$\n*   **Uses:** Bleaching cotton/linen, oxidizing agent in chemical industries, disinfecting drinking water.\n\n### 3. Baking Soda ($\\ce{NaHCO3}$)\n*   **Chemical Name:** Sodium hydrogen carbonate.\n*   **Preparation (Solvay Process step):**\n    $$ \\ce{NaCl + H2O + CO2 + NH3 -> NH4Cl + NaHCO3} $$\n*   **Reaction upon Heating (Cooking):**\n    $$ \\ce{2NaHCO3 ->[\\Delta] Na2CO3 + H2O + CO2} $$\n    *The $\\ce{CO2}$ produced causes bread/cake to rise.*\n*   **Uses:** Antacid ingredient, fire extinguishers, making baking powder (mixture of baking soda + mild edible acid like tartaric acid).\n\n### 4. Washing Soda ($\\ce{Na2CO3.10H2O}$)\n*   **Preparation:** Recrystallization of sodium carbonate.\n*   **Reaction:**\n    $$ \\ce{Na2CO3 + 10H2O -> Na2CO3.10H2O} $$\n*   **Uses:** Glass, soap, and paper industries; cleaning agent; removing permanent hardness of water.\n\n### 5. Plaster of Paris ($\\ce{CaSO4.\\frac{1}{2}H2O}$)\n*   **Chemical Name:** Calcium sulphate hemihydrate.\n*   **Preparation:** Heating Gypsum ($\\ce{CaSO4.2H2O}$) at $373 K$.\n    $$ \\ce{CaSO4.2H2O ->[373 K] CaSO4.\\frac{1}{2}H2O + 1\\frac{1}{2}H2O} $$\n*   **Uses:** Doctors use it for supporting fractured bones, making toys, materials for decoration, smoothing surfaces.\n*   *Note:* If heated above $373 K$, all water is lost forming \"Dead Burnt Plaster\" ($\\ce{CaSO4}$).\n\n### Conclusion\nCommon salt ($\\ce{NaCl}$) is an essential industrial raw material. Through various chemical processes like electrolysis and thermal decomposition, it yields vital compounds used in hygiene, construction, and food industries.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Water of Crystallization\n\n### Are Crystals of Salts Really Dry?\nMany salts contain water molecules trapped inside their crystal structure. This is called **Water of Crystallization**. It is the fixed number of water molecules present in one formula unit of a salt.\n\n### Examples\n1.  **Copper Sulphate:** $\\ce{CuSO4.5H2O}$ (Blue color).\n2.  **Ferrous Sulphate:** $\\ce{FeSO4.7H2O}$ (Green color).\n3.  **Gypsum:** $\\ce{CaSO4.2H2O}$ (White).\n\n### Activity: Heating Copper Sulphate\nWhen blue copper sulphate crystals are heated, the water is removed, and the salt turns white ($\\ce{CuSO4}$). If you moisten the crystals again with water, the blue color reappears.\n$$ \\ce{CuSO4.5H2O(s) (Blue) ->[\\Delta] CuSO4(s) (White) + 5H2O(g)} $$\n\n[DIAGRAM: Test tube holder holding a boiling tube with blue copper sulphate crystals over a burner. Water droplets shown condensing on the upper cooler parts of the tube.]\n\n### Conclusion\nWater of crystallization is integral to the shape and color of many salt crystals. Though the salts appear dry, this chemically bonded water determines their physical properties and can be reversibly removed by heat.\n\n---\n**© 2025 Sandeep Coaching Classes.
