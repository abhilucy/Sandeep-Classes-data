THE HUMAN EYE\nThe human eye is one of the most valuable and sensitive sense organs. It enables us to see the wonderful world and the colours around us. It acts like a camera, focusing light onto a light-sensitive screen called the retina.\n\n#### Key Parts and Functions:\n*   **Cornea:** The transparent spherical membrane covering the front of the eye. Most of the refraction occurs at the outer surface of the cornea.\n*   **Iris:** A dark muscular diaphragm that controls the size of the pupil.\n*   **Pupil:** The central aperture in the iris. It regulates and controls the amount of light entering the eye.\n*   **Eye Lens:** A crystalline, double convex lens that provides the finer adjustment of focal length required to focus objects at different distances on the retina.\n*   **Ciliary Muscles:** These muscles hold the eye lens and modify its curvature to adjust the focal length.\n*   **Retina:** A delicate membrane having enormous numbers of light-sensitive cells (rods and cones).\n*   **Optic Nerve:** Transmits visual information from the retina to the brain in the form of electrical signals.\n\n[DIAGRAM: Structure of the Human Eye]\n\n---\n\n### 2. POWER OF ACCOMMODATION\nThe ability of the eye lens to adjust its focal length is called **accommodation**. \n\n*   **Relaxed Ciliary Muscles:** Lens becomes thin, focal length increases ($f \\uparrow$). This enables us to see distant objects clearly.\n*   **Contracted Ciliary Muscles:** Lens becomes thick (more curved), focal length decreases ($f \\downarrow$). This enables us to see nearby objects clearly.\n*   **Least Distance of Distinct Vision (Near Point):** The minimum distance at which objects can be seen most distinctly without strain. For a normal adult eye, it is $25\\text{ cm}$.\n*   **Far Point:** The farthest point up to which the eye can see objects clearly. For a normal eye, it is infinity ($\\infty$).\n\n---\n\n### 3. DEFECTS OF VISION AND THEIR CORRECTION\n\n#### A. Myopia (Near-sightedness)\n*   **Description:** A person can see nearby objects clearly but cannot see distant objects distinctly.\n*   **Cause:** Excessive curvature of the eye lens or elongation of the eyeball.\n*   **Image Formation:** The image of a distant object is formed in front of the retina.\n*   **Correction:** Use of a **Concave lens** of suitable power.\n\n[DIAGRAM: Myopic Eye and Correction using Concave Lens]\n\n#### B. Hypermetropia (Far-sightedness)\n*   **Description:** A person can see distant objects clearly but cannot see nearby objects distinctly.\n*   **Cause:** Focal length of the eye lens is too long or the eyeball has become too small.\n*   **Image Formation:** The image of a nearby object is formed behind the retina.\n*   **Correction:** Use of a **Convex lens** of suitable power.\n\n[DIAGRAM: Hypermetropic Eye and Correction using Convex Lens]\n\n#### C. Presbyopia\n*   **Description:** The power of accommodation of the eye usually decreases with ageing. \n*   **Cause:** Gradual weakening of ciliary muscles and diminishing flexibility of the eye lens.\n*   **Correction:** Use of **Bifocal lenses** (upper part is concave for distant vision, lower part is convex for reading).\n\n---\n\n### 4. REFRACTION OF LIGHT THROUGH A PRISM\nWhen a ray of light passes through a glass prism, it bends towards the base.\n*   **Angle of Deviation ($D$ or $\\delta$):** The angle between the incident ray and the emergent ray.\n\n[DIAGRAM: Refraction through a Glass Prism]\n\n---\n\n### 5. DISPERSION OF WHITE LIGHT\nThe splitting of white light into its component colours ($VIBGYOR$) when passed through a glass prism is called **Dispersion**.\n\n*   **Spectrum:** The band of the coloured components of a light beam.\n*   **Cause:** Different colours of light bend through different angles with respect to the incident ray. Red light bends the least, while violet light bends the most.\n*   **Newton’s Experiment:** Isaac Newton used two identical prisms—one in an upright position and the other in an inverted position—to show that white light is composed of seven colours and can be recombined.\n\n[DIAGRAM: Dispersion of White Light by a Glass Prism]\n\n#### Formation of a Rainbow\nA rainbow is a natural spectrum appearing in the sky after a rain shower. It is caused by:\n1.  **Refraction**\n2.  **Dispersion**\n3.  **Internal Reflection**\n\n[DIAGRAM: Formation of Rainbow in Water Droplet]\n\n---\n\n### 6. ATMOSPHERIC REFRACTION\nThe refraction of light by different layers of the Earth's atmosphere (having varying optical densities) is called atmospheric refraction.\n\n*   **Twinkling of Stars:** Due to the continuous changing of the physical conditions of the Earth’s atmosphere, the apparent position of the star fluctuates, and the amount of light entering the eye flickers.\n*   **Advanced Sunrise and Delayed Sunset:** The Sun is visible to us about $2$ minutes before the actual sunrise, and about $2$ minutes after the actual sunset because of atmospheric refraction.\n\n[DIAGRAM: Atmospheric Refraction Effects]\n\n---\n\n### 7. SCATTERING OF LIGHT\nScattering of light is the phenomenon in which light rays are deviated from their straight path on striking an obstacle like dust or water vapours.\n\n*   **Tyndall Effect:** The phenomenon of scattering of light by colloidal particles.\n*   **Why is the sky blue?** Fine particles in the atmosphere scatter blue light (shorter wavelength) more strongly than red light (longer wavelength).\n*   **Colour of the Sun at Sunrise and Sunset:** Light from the Sun near the horizon passes through thicker layers of air. Most of the blue light is scattered away, leaving the longer wavelength **Red** light to reach our eyes.\n*   **Danger signals are Red:** Red is scattered the least by fog or smoke, making it visible from a distance.\n\n[DIAGRAM: Scattering of Light - Tyndall Effect]\n\n---\n[CENTER] *End of Notes*\n[CENTER] **Prepared by: Content Management Team, Sandeep Coaching Classes**"
