THE HUMAN EYE\nThe human eye is one of the most valuable and sensitive sense organs. It uses light and enables us to see the colorful world around us. It acts like a camera, focusing light onto a light-sensitive screen called the **retina**.\n\n#### Key Parts and Functions:\n*   **Cornea:** The transparent spherical membrane covering the front of the eye. Most of the refraction occurs at the outer surface of the cornea.\n*   **Iris:** A dark muscular diaphragm that controls the size of the pupil.\n*   **Pupil:** The opening in the center of the iris that regulates and controls the amount of light entering the eye.\n*   **Eye Lens:** A crystalline double convex lens that forms an inverted real image of the object on the retina.\n*   **Retina:** A delicate membrane having an enormous number of light-sensitive cells (rods and cones).\n*   **Optic Nerve:** Transmits visual information from the retina to the brain in the form of electrical signals.\n\n[DIAGRAM: Structure of Human Eye | Cornea as the outermost layer | Retina as the screen where image forms]\n\n---\n\n### 2. POWER OF ACCOMMODATION\nThe ability of the eye lens to adjust its focal length is called **accommodation**.\n*   **When muscles are relaxed:** The lens becomes thin, focal length increases, and we see distant objects clearly.\n*   **When muscles contract:** The lens becomes thick, focal length decreases, and we see nearby objects clearly.\n*   **Near Point (Least Distance of Distinct Vision):** 25 cm for a normal adult eye.\n*   **Far Point:** Infinity for a normal eye.\n\n---\n\n### 3. DEFECTS OF VISION AND THEIR CORRECTION\n#### A. Myopia (Near-sightedness)\nA person can see nearby objects clearly but cannot see distant objects distinctly.\n*   **Cause:** Excessive curvature of the eye lens or elongation of the eyeball.\n*   **Correction:** Use of a **Concave lens** of suitable power.\n[DIAGRAM: Myopia and its Correction | Image formed in front of retina | Concave lens diverges rays to focus on retina]\n\n#### B. Hypermetropia (Far-sightedness)\nA person can see distant objects clearly but cannot see nearby objects distinctly.\n*   **Cause:** Focal length of the eye lens is too long or the eyeball has become too small.\n*   **Correction:** Use of a **Convex lens** of suitable power.\n[DIAGRAM: Hypermetropia Correction | Image formed behind retina | Convex lens converges rays to focus on retina]\n\n#### C. Presbyopia\nThe power of accommodation of the eye usually decreases with aging. \n*   **Cause:** Gradual weakening of ciliary muscles and diminishing flexibility of the eye lens.\n*   **Correction:** Use of **Bi-focal lenses** (upper part concave, lower part convex).\n\n---\n\n### 4. REFRACTION OF LIGHT THROUGH A PRISM\nWhen a ray of light passes through a glass prism, it bends towards the base.\n*   **Angle of Deviation (δ):** The angle between the incident ray and the emergent ray.\n*   **Dispersion:** The splitting of white light into its component colors (VIBGYOR). \n*   **Spectrum:** The band of the colored components of a light beam.\n\n[DIAGRAM: Dispersion through Prism | White light entering | VIBGYOR colors emerging]\n\n---\n\n### 5. ATMOSPHERIC REFRACTION\nThe refraction of light by the Earth's atmosphere due to varying optical densities of air layers.\n*   **Twinkling of Stars:** Due to the continuous changing of the atmosphere, the apparent position of the star fluctuates, causing the amount of light entering our eye to vary.\n*   **Advanced Sunrise and Delayed Sunset:** The Sun is visible to us about 2 minutes before the actual sunrise and 2 minutes after the actual sunset due to atmospheric refraction.\n\n---\n\n### 6. SCATTERING OF LIGHT\nScattering occurs when light hits particles like dust, water droplets, or gas molecules.\n*   **Tyndall Effect:** The phenomenon of scattering of light by colloidal particles.\n*   **Why is the sky blue?** Fine particles in the atmosphere scatter blue light (shorter wavelength) more strongly than red light.\n*   **Color of Sun at Sunrise/Sunset:** Light travels a longer distance through the atmosphere. Most blue light is scattered away, leaving the longer-wavelength **red light** to reach our eyes.\n\n[DIAGRAM: Scattering of Light | Sun at Zenith (Less scattering/White) | Sun at Horizon (More scattering/Red)]\n\n---\n**Note:** *Practice the ray diagrams for Myopia and Hypermetropia correction as they are frequently asked in Board Examinations.*\n\n**SANDEEP COACHING CLASSES | QUALITY EDUCATION FOR A BRIGHTER FUTURE**"
