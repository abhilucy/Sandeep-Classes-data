(ii) Humans have a 4-chambered heart (two atria, two ventricles). The inter-atrial and inter-ventricular septa completely separate the left (oxygenated) and right (deoxygenated) sides, preventing mixing. \nOR\nB. Water is transported in plants through xylem tissue. The main driving force is the transpiration pull generated by the evaporation of water from leaves (transpiration), which creates a suction force (cohesion-tension theory) pulling the water column up.

Find the current drawn by the bulbs from the mains.\nOR\n(b) (i) State Joule’s law of heating. Express it mathematically when an appliance of resistance R is connected to a source of voltage V and the current I flows through the appliance for a time t.\n(ii) A 5 Ω resistor is connected across a battery of 6 volts.

        "answer": "(a) (i) Electric Power is the rate at which electrical energy is consumed or dissipated in an electric circuit. SI unit: Watt (W).\n(ii) Total Power P = P1 + P2 = 100W + 60W = 160W. Voltage V = 220V. Current I = P/V = 160/220 = 8/11 A ≈ 0.727 A.\nOR\n(b) (i) Joule's Law of Heating states that heat produced in a resistor is directly proportional to the square of current (I²), resistance (R), and time (t). Mathematically: H = I²Rt (or H = VIt).\n(ii) V=6V, R=5Ω, t=10s. H = V²/R * t = (6*6)/5 * 10 = 36/5 * 10 = 7.2 * 10 = 72 Joules."

        "question": "The mechanism by which the sex of an individual is determined is called sex-determination. In human beings, sex of a newborn is genetically determined, whereas in some others it is not. There are 46 (23 pairs) chromosomes in human beings. Out of these, 44 (22 pairs) control the body characters and 2 (one pair) are known as sex chromosomes. The sex chromosomes are of two types — X chromosome and Y chromosome. At the time of fertilisation, depending upon which type of male gamete fuses with the female gamete, the sex of the newborn child is decided.\n(a) Why is a pair of sex chromosomes in human beings called a mismatched pair in terms of type and size ?\n(b) Out of male or female, which of them has a perfect pair of sex chromosomes ? In case of a perfect pair, will the gametes produced be of the same kind or of a different kind ?\n(c) (i) Name two animals whose sex is not genetically determined. Explain the process of their sex determination.\nOR\n(c) (ii) With the help of a flowchart only, show how sex is genetically determined in human beings.",

Sex is determined by the environmental temperature at which fertilized eggs are incubated.\n(c) (ii) [Flowchart showing XX x XY -> Gametes X, X and X, Y -> Offspring XX (Female) and XY (Male)]."

They do not cross because if they did, there would be two directions of the magnetic field at the point of intersection, which is impossible.\n(c) (ii) By placing the compass at the north pole, marking the direction of the needle, moving the compass so its tail is at the previous mark, and repeating until the south pole is reached.
