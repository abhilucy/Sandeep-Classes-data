So ∠QPB = ∠A.\nTherefore x = ∠A.\nSince ∠QBP is part of 90°, and Q, B, C are collinear... actually, let's use angles in ΔPQC.\n∠QPC = 90° - ∠QPB (since QP is tangent and AP is normal-ish... actually ∠APB=90, so ∠CPB=90. Tangent QP makes angle A with PB. So with perpendicular PC, it makes 90-A).\n∠C = 90° - A.\nThus, ∠QPC = ∠C.\nSo ΔPQC is isosceles with QP = QC.\nSince QB = QP and QP = QC, then QB = QC.\nHence Q bisects BC."

        "question": "Case Study - 1\nSome students are having a misconception while comparing decimals. For example, a student may mention that 78.56 > 78.9 as 7856 > 789. In order to assess this concept, a decimal comparison test was administered to the students of class VI through the following question : In the recently held Sports Day in the school, 5 students participated in a javelin throw competition. The distances to which they have thrown the javelin are shown below in the table :\nName | Distance (m)\nAjay | 47.7\nBijoy | 47.07\nKartik | 43.09\nDinesh | 43.9\nDevesh | 45.2\nThe students were asked to identify who has thrown the javelin the farthest.\nBased on the test attempted by the students, the teacher concludes that 40% of the students have the misconception in the concept of decimal comparison and the rest do not have the misconception. 80% of the students having misconception answered Bijoy as the correct answer in the paper. 90% of the students who are identified with not having misconception, did not answer Bijoy as their answer.\nOn the basis of the above information, answer the following questions :\n(i) What is the probability of a student not having misconception but still answers Bijoy in the test ?\n(ii) What is the probability that a randomly selected student answers Bijoy as his answer in the test ?\n(iii) (a) What is the probability that a student who answered as Bijoy is having misconception ?\nOR\n(iii) (b) What is the probability that a student who answered as Bijoy is amongst students who do not have the misconception ?",

        "question": "Case Study - 2\nAn engineer is designing a new metro rail network in a city.\nInitially, two metro lines, Line A and Line B, each consisting of multiple stations are designed. The track for Line A is represented by l₁ : (x-2)/3 = (y+1)/-2 = (z-3)/4 , while the track for Line B is represented by l₂ : (x-1)/2 = (y-3)/1 = (z+2)/-3 .\nBased on the above information, answer the following questions :\n(i) Find whether the two metro tracks are parallel.\n(ii) Solar panels are to be installed on the rooftop of the metro stations. Determine the equation of the line representing the placement of solar panels on the rooftop of Line A's stations, given that panels are to be positioned parallel to Line A's track (l₁) and pass through the point (1, -2, -3).\n(iii) (a) To connect the stations, a pedestrian pathway perpendicular to the two metro lines is to be constructed which passes through point (3, 2, 1). Determine the equation of the pedestrian walkway.\nOR\n(iii) (b) Find the shortest distance between Line A and Line B.",

        "question": "Case Study - 3\nDuring a heavy gaming session, the temperature of a student's laptop processor increases significantly. After the session, the processor begins to cool down, and the rate of cooling is proportional to the difference between the processor's temperature and the room temperature (25°C). Initially the processor's temperature is 85°C. The rate of cooling is defined by the equation d/dt(T(t)) = -k(T(t) - 25), where T(t) represents the temperature of the processor at time t (in minutes) and k is a constant.\nBased on the above information, answer the following questions :\n(i) Find the expression for temperature of processor, T(t) given that T(0) = 85°C.\n(ii) How long will it take for the processor's temperature to reach 40°C ? Given that k = 0.03, logₑ 4 = 1.3863.",
